To index your data using a local LLM, you will need to follow these steps:

Install the LangChain library.
Create a new project directory.
In the project directory, create a file called index.py.
In index.py, import the following modules:

```python
import langchain
import os
import json
# In index.py, define the following variables:

# The path to the local LLM.
LLM_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "my_llm.pkl")

# The path to the data to be indexed.
DATA_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "data.json")

# The name of the index to create.
INDEX_NAME = "my_index"

# In index.py, create a new Index object:
index = langchain.Index(LLM_PATH, INDEX_NAME)

# In index.py, add the data to the index:
with open(DATA_PATH, "r") as f:
  data = json.load(f)

index.add_data(data)

# In index.py, save the index:
index.save()
```

Once you have completed these steps, you will have successfully indexed your data using a local LLM.
