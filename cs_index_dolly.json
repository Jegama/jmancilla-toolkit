The tips in this article may also help if you encounter an issue connecting with a third-party app.\nCheck your phone or tablet\nIf your Roku device is missing from the discovery screen, check that your phone or tablet is configured properly.\n\n\nIs your phone or tablet connected to the correct Wi-Fi network? From the Home screen on your Roku device, go to Settings > Network > About to see the name of the network your Roku device is connected to and compare it to the network your mobile device is connected to. If your phone or tablet is connected to a different network, it will not be able to control your Roku device. Learn what to look for if you need help finding the correct Wi-Fi network.\n\n\n\nIs your Apple device permitted to access other devices over Wi-Fi? If you have an iPhone or iPad and it is running iOS 14 or higher, you must grant \"Local Network\" access to allow the Roku mobile app to see and connect with your Roku device. A prompt asking you to grant permission typically appears the first time you launch a new app, or you can use the steps below to do it from the iOS settings.\nOpen Settings on your iPhone or iPad\nScroll down the list of installed apps and select Roku\n\nTap Local Network until the slider is green\n\n\n\n\n\nIs your mobile device connected to a VPN?

If you use your phone or tablet to connect remotely for work, check that it is not connected to a VPN when using the Roku mobile app. Some VPN applications route all traffic through the virtual network causing your Roku device to not to be visible.\n\nConfirm Wi-Fi access is enabled on your Roku device\nFor the Roku mobile app for iOS\u00ae or AndroidTM to work as your remote, your Roku device must be permitted to accept commands over the Wi-Fi network. There is a Control by mobile apps setting on your Roku device that when disabled, prevents the Roku mobile app and any third-party app from communicating with your Roku device. When this setting is disabled, you must use your Roku remote and enable the setting again using the following steps.\n\nPress Home  on your remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Advanced system settings\n\nSelect Control by mobile apps\n\nSelect Network access\n\nChoose one of three options:\n\nDefault. For users who want to use the Roku mobile app or a third-party app to control their Roku device. Most users choose this setting.\n\nPermissive. For users who want the Roku mobile app or a third-party app to control their Roku device and are on a publicly accessible network. This choice is uncommon, and typically used with an advanced network configuration.\n\nDisable: For users who do not want the Roku mobile app or a third-party app to be able to control their Roku device.\n\n\n\nWhen your Roku device is configured to allow Wi-Fi network access (set to Default for most users), it should appear on the discovery screen of the Roku mobile app.\nVerify your network is configured properly\nIf your phone or tablet is configured properly and network access is enabled on your Roku device, check the configuration of your network.\n\n\nIs your Roku device using a wired Ethernet connection? If your Roku device is connected to a wired network using an Ethernet cable, check that it is assigned an IP address in the same range as the wireless devices on your network, such as your phone or tablet. For example, if your wired Roku device is assigned 192.168.2.169 and your phone is assigned 192.168.1.173, the devices will likely be unable to communicate. Ideally, the wired Roku device in this example should be assigned an address like 192.168.1.169 where that third number (or octet) matches the third octet of your wireless devices. You may be able to adjust the range of IP addresses assigned to wired and wireless devices by your router*, but if you are not comfortable configuring network equipment, you should consult a local professional for help.\n\n\n\nHave you checked the network names closely? Many Wi-Fi routers today use two signals to provide better speed and coverage. These devices are generally referred to as dual-band routers because they transmit data at the lower 2.4 GHz band and the higher 5 GHz band. When connecting devices to your wireless network, choices may include more than one network with a similar name. For example, you may see something like MyNetwork_2.4GHz and MyNetwork_5GHz. Confirm that your Roku device and your phone or tablet are connected to the same band and network name.\n\n\n\nIs your Roku device using a public IP address? Devices on your network, such as your Roku device, should be using a private IP address that falls within one of the following ranges:\n\n\n Start \n End \n\n\n\n\n 10.0.0.0 \n 10.255.255.255 \n\n\n 172.16.0.0 \n 173.32.255.255 \n\n\n 192.168.0.0 \n 192.168.255.255 \n\n\n\nYou can find the IP address of your Roku device by going to Settings > Network > About. If the IP address is not within one of these private ranges, your Roku device is using a public IP address which is most common when a router is not present on your network. Install a router to manage IP addresses or contact your internet service provider (ISP) or the person who manages your network to help resolve the problem.\n\n\n\nIs Access Point (AP) isolation enabled on your network? AP isolation prevents devices from communicating on a Wi-Fi network. Refer to documentation for your router to learn how to check and disable this setting or contact the person who manages your network for help.\n\nAdditional troubleshooting steps\nIf the troubleshooting tips above did not help and your device still does not appear on the discovery screen, try the following suggestions.\n\n\nRestart your Roku device. To restart your Roku device, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it. Or you can use the following steps to restart it from the Settings menu.\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter your Roku device powers back on, make sure it is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network.\n\n\n\n\nRestart the Roku mobile app. Restart the app by doing one of the following: \n\nOn an Apple device, swipe up, or double click the iOS home button and then swipe the Roku app to close it.\nOn an Android device, press the Recents button and then swipe the Roku app to close it.\n\n\n\nConnect to your Roku device manually. Locate the IP address of your Roku device by going to Settings > Network > About, and then use the steps below to connect manually.\nLaunch the Roku mobile app\nTap Devices \n\nTap Get help?\n\nSelect Connect manually\n\nEnter the IP address of your Roku device and tap CONNECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet.

The steps in that article will help you diagnose potential issues with existing network connections. Once you have checked your Roku streaming device and the internet connection, use the steps below to ensure that your connections are working properly:\n\n\nSelect your wireless network and enter the password correctly. Keep in mind that network passwords are case sensitive. Use the shift button on the on-screen keyboard to enter a capital letter. You can get additional help if you need to find your wireless password and network name.\n\nEnsure your router is working properly. If you can connect to the internet from another device, such as your computer or phone, your router is successfully providing internet access and you can move to the next step. If you are unable to connect to the internet, try restarting your router.\n\nImprove the strength of your wireless signal. If resetting your router does not improve your connection, the issue may be the strength of the wireless signal. The farther your Roku device is from your router, the weaker your wireless signal. There are several tips to help improve your wireless signal.\n\nTry an Ethernet cable, or a third-party adapter. If establishing a wireless connection is difficult, an Ethernet cable will provide a faster, more reliable connection. All Roku streaming devices have the ability to connect to a router via wireless. Some Roku streaming devices also have an Ethernet port, or use a third-party adapter to connect to the internet. If your Roku device does not have an Ethernet port, learn more about how to connect to the internet using a third-party adapter.\n\nRestart your router. To restart your router, check the instructions from your Internet Service Provider or router vendor. In some cases, you can simply unplug it and plug it back in. Other cases may require pressing a reset button on the device.\n\nRestart your Roku device. To restart your device, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it.

You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network: If your router and Roku device both support 5GHz, make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network.\n\n\nNote: Not all Roku devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the wireless channel: When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\n\n\n\nIf your Roku device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network: Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your Roku device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common. Additionally, if your 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless networks have different network names, your Roku device will only be able to connect to the 2.4GHz wireless network.To optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your Roku device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\nMove the router farther away: If your router is close to your Roku device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your Roku device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem.

Before you begin troubleshooting, first determine which type of handheld remote you use with your Roku streaming device: A Roku simple remote or a Roku voice remote. A Roku remote with a voice button that has a microphone icon, or a magnifying glass icon is a Roku voice remote. A remote that does not have a voice button is a Roku simple remote.\n\nIf you have a Roku TouchTM Tabletop Remote, see the tabletop remote troubleshooting guide instead.\nIf you need additional help figuring out which remote you have, review our guidelines for determining the type of Roku remote.\nHow the Roku simple and Roku voice remotes work\nHow does my Roku simple remote work?\nYour Roku simple remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to transmit button presses a short distance. For your simple remote to operate reliably, it must be pointed directly at your Roku streaming device and there must be nothing blocking the signal from travelling to the front of that device, where the IR receiver is located.\n\nTo set up a simple remote, you only need to insert new matching batteries and point the remote directly at the front of your streaming device when you are using it.\nHow does my Roku voice remote work?\nYour Roku voice remote communicates with your Roku streaming device over a dedicated wireless connection. Unlike a simple remote, you do not need to point your voice remote directly at your streaming device when pressing buttons. This allows you to install your streaming device behind a wall-mounted TV or another nearby, out-of-sight location.\nWhen setting up your voice remote, your streaming device uses a discovery process called pairing to detect a new remote and create the direct wireless connection. If your voice remote came in the box with your Roku device, you likely completed the pairing process during the initial setup and activation. If you upgraded to a voice remote after your Roku device was set up, you likely completed the pairing process from the Settings menu. Learn more about how to set up your Roku voice remote.\nTroubleshooting your Roku simple remote\nTo resolve issues with your Roku simple remote, start by looking for visible obstructions. The most common issue for a simple remote is missed button presses, which happen when your Roku streaming device is in a location where the remote signal is partially or fully blocked. Here are a few tips to ensure a clear path from your remote to your streaming device:\n\n\nAlways be sure you can see the front of your Roku device. When the device is powered on, you should see the status light on the front of the device.\n\nTest your remote from various positions. Try holding your remote higher (e.g., above your head) and point it downwards at the front of your Roku streaming device. Move the remote to the left and right, making sure it is always pointing directly at the front of your streaming device. If your streaming device becomes more responsive when testing from various positions, check that no obstructions are blocking the front of your device or the signal from your remote. If possible, move your streaming device to a position where it responds more reliably..\n\nDo not hide your streaming player. If your streaming player is attached to your TV with the included adhesive strip, move it to a position where the signal is less likely to be blocked. Do not install it inside a closed cabinet or behind your TV.\n\n\nTroubleshooting your Roku voice remote\nIf your Roku voice remote is unresponsive, there are several troubleshooting steps you can take to attempt to solve any issues. Prior to taking any troubleshooting steps, it is important to know what type of battery your remote has, since troubleshooting steps will vary slightly. There are two varieties: Those that have a built-in rechargeable battery and those that use standard batteries.\nIf you are experiencing a different issue where your voice remote is not controlling power or volume on your TV, additional help is available in this detailed article.\nTroubleshoot your rechargeable voice remote:\nRoku voice remotes with a rechargeable battery do not have a battery compartment. Both the status light and pairing button are located directly on the back of the remote.\n\nEnsure your Roku streaming device is up to date\nVerify your streaming device is running Roku OS 9.4 or higher. Go to Settings > System > About to check the software version. If necessary, manually check your device for an update.\nRe-pair your voice remote to your streaming device\nPut your streaming device in pairing mode:\n\nRemove the power cable from your streaming device\nWait at least 5 seconds\nRe-connect the power cable\nWait for your streaming device to power on, and the Home screen to appear on your TV screen\nWithin 30 seconds of seeing the Home screen on your TV screen, put your voice remote into pairing mode\n\nPut your voice remote in pairing mode:\n\nPress and hold the pairing button on your voice remote for 20 seconds. The status light should slowly flash green, stop, and then flash rapidly. When this happens, release the pairing button and your remote will restart.\nPress and hold the pairing button for 5 seconds, or until you see the status light begin to flash. If the light does not flash, charge your remote.\nWait for 30 seconds while the remote establishes a connection with your streaming device.\n\nOnce you streaming device and remote are connected, the pairing dialog will appear on your TV screen.\nRecharge your voice remote\nIf you have not already attempted to recharge your voice remote:\n\nConnect the small, micro-USB end of the charging cable to the charging port on your remote\nConnect the other end to a standard USB power adaptor\nThe status light will flash slowly when charging and change to a solid green when complete\n\nIf the status light does not begin to flash within a few seconds, try an alternate charging cable and power adaptor. Remember to use the Roku provided micro-USB cable that came with your voice remote for the best results. If you are still having issues, please restart your device and try again.\nTroubleshoot your voice remote with standard batteries:\nRoku voice remotes with standard batteries and a microphone pinhole beneath the power power button have the pairing button and status light beneath the battery cover on the back of the remote. On some older Roku voice remotes, the status light is located on the front of the remote.\nRoku voice remotes with standard batteries and a microphone pinhole to the left of the power power button do not have a pairing button. The status light is located to the left of the power button beneath the surface of the plastic and is not visible until lit.\n \nRe-pair your voice remote to your streaming device\nPut your streaming device in pairing mode:\n\nRemove the power cable from your streaming device\nWait at least 5 seconds\nRe-connect the power cable\nWait for your streaming device to power on, and the Home screen to appear on your TV screen\nWithin 30 seconds of seeing the Home screen on your TV screen, put your voice remote into pairing mode\n\nPut your voice remote in pairing mode:\n\nRemove the battery cover on the back of your voice remote\nRemove both batteries from the battery compartment\nWait 5 seconds and then reinsert the batteries\nIf your remote has a pairing button, press and hold the pairing button for 5 seconds, or until you see the status light begin to flash.\nIf your remote does not have a pairing button, press and hold both the Home  button and Back  button for 5 seconds, or until you see the status light begin to flash.\nIf the status light does not flash, try replacing the batteries.\nWait for 30 seconds while the remote establishes a connection with your streaming device.\n\nOnce you streaming device and remote are connected, the pairing dialog will appear on your TV screen.\nReplace your remote batteries\n\nRemove the battery cover on the back of your remote\nRemove both batteries from the battery compartment\nReplace the batteries with a new matching pair and test again\n\nAdditional troubleshooting steps for all Roku remotes\nIf your Roku remote is lagging, unresponsive, or otherwise unable to control your Roku streaming device, and you have not yet attempted these steps, try the list of troubleshooting tips below:\nInstall an HDMI\u00ae extension cable\nWhen using a Roku\u00ae Streaming Stick\u00ae that can be connected directly to an HDMI port on your TV, wireless interference from the HDMI connector may impact the performance of your remote. If you are troubleshooting a Roku Streaming Stick, move it away from the HDMI connector on your TV by installing a free extension cable.\nTroubleshoot your remote batteries\nIf your remote uses standard batteries, slide open the battery cover, remove the batteries for a moment and then reinsert them. With a Roku simple remote, you can immediately try to control your streaming device. With a Roku voice remote, wait at least 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes a connection with your streaming device. To test for a successful connection, press the voice button and look for a status indicator on your TV screen. If the issue is not resolved, replace the batteries with a new matching pair and try again.\nIf your remote is rechargeable, press and hold the pairing button for 20 seconds. The status light should slowly flash green, stop, then flash rapidly. When this happens, release the pairing button and your remote has restarted. Wait at least 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes a connection with your streaming device. To test for a successful connection, press the voice button and look for a status indicator on your TV screen.\nReplace your Roku remote\nIf none of the previous steps solved the issue, you may need to replace your remote. You can buy a new Roku remote from the Roku accessories store. Make sure your streaming device is listed as a compatible device before making a purchase.\nAdvanced tips for your Roku voice remote\nIf you have a Roku voice remote and are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku streaming device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network. If your router and streaming device both support 5GHz, enable the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network. Keep in mind that not all Roku streaming devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\n\n\nChange the wireless channel. When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually. To help you find un-congested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\nIf your streaming device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network. Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your streaming device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common.\nTo optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your streaming device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\n\nMove the router farther away. If your router is close to your streaming device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your streaming device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\nWarm or hot to touch\nIf the back of your Roku remote gets warm or hot during normal use, the rechargeable battery may be damaged or the alkaline batteries may be corroded.\n\nDiscontinue use of your remote.\nDisconnect your rechargeable remote from the charging cable.\nPlace remote on a hard non-flammable surface (like tile) and let it cool. Do not attempt to remove the alkaline batteries while hot!\n\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet.

Free streaming subscription trials automatically turn into paid subscriptions that are billed on a recurring basis. To avoid being charged for a subscription, you must cancel your subscription on or before the last day of the free trial period. If the charge is for a subscription that you no longer want, you can cancel the subscription to prevent future charges.\nYou have multiple Roku devices and multiple Roku accounts and have signed up for subscriptions on each of the different devices. If so, you may be getting charged twice. If you\u2019re going to share subscriptions across Roku devices, you must use the same Roku account to sign up for services. To determine what email you\u2019re using with each Roku device, you can verify your email.\nA family member or roommate who shares your Roku device made a purchase without your knowledge. If you share your Roku device with others, you may want to create a PIN to protect against unauthorized purchases in the future.\nCheck whether you have multiple Roku accounts\nIf you can't find the charge in your purchase history, it\u2019s possible that you have more than one Roku account and have made the purchase or signed up for the subscription through a different Roku account. If so, you may not realize you're getting charged for a subscription or you may be getting charged twice for the same subscription.\nIf you\u2019re going to share subscriptions across Roku devices, Roku recommends using the same Roku account to sign up for services. To determine what Roku account you\u2019re using with each Roku device, verify the email that you used to set it up the device.\nTo keep your charges and subscriptions organized in one place, Roku recommends that you use 1 Roku account to set up all your devices.\nIf you still don\u2019t recognize the charge\nIf you still don't recognize the charge after reviewing it, contact customer support.

If you plan to use the Roku mobile app to control your streaming device, it is important these devices are connected to the same network. To make sure your streaming device is connected to the correct network, use the guidelines below.\n\nCheck to see what network your computer or mobile device is connected to. This information is typically found in the settings for your device, often in a section titled \"Network\", \"Network & Internet\", \"Wi-Fi\", or something similar. Your Roku streaming device should be connected to the same wireless network.\nIf you do not see your network name on the list of available networks in the \u201cChoose your network\u201d screen when connecting your streaming device, select Scan again to see all networks. This will rescan for Wi-Fi signals and present a list of all networks that are available.\nIf you cannot remember the name of your wireless network, go to the support site for your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. Also, sometimes the default name is listed on the bottom of the router.\n\nHow to get your wireless password\n\nEnter the same wireless password that you use to connect your computer or mobile device to your home network.\nIf you have forgotten the password, go to the support site for your ISP or router manufacturer. They will be able to suggest the specific methods for their products to recover the password or reset it. Sometimes the default password is listed on the bottom of the router.\n\nTips for entering passwords\n\nPasswords are case sensitive \u2013 use the shift key  on the on-screen keyboard to enter a capital letter.\nSelect Show password or hide password on the password entry screen. This will allow you to view or hide your password as you enter it.\n\nHelp for your smart home device\nHow to find your wireless network name\nWhen setting up your Roku Smart Home camera or video doorbell, the Roku Smart Home mobile app generates a QR code to share the network details with your camera or doorbell. Because a 2.4GHz wireless network is required to make the connection, it is important to connect your phone or tablet to your 2.4GHz network before launching the app.\n\nYou may see two similar choices with your network name like MyNetwork_2.4GHz and MyNetwork_5GHz. Be sure to select the network that ends with \"2.4GHz\" or similar.\nYou may only see one choice with your network name. In this case, it is likely that your router is single-band and only supports a 2.4GHz network, or it is dual-band and routes traffic automatically to the proper channel. This network should work with your smart home devices.\nIf you cannot remember the name of your wireless network, go to the support site for your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. Also, sometimes the default name is listed on the bottom of the router.\n\nTips for entering passwords\n\nPasswords are case sensitive \u2013 make sure to type yours correctly.\nIf you have forgotten the password, go to the support site for your ISP or router manufacturer. They will be able to suggest the specific methods for their products to recover the password or reset it. Sometimes the default password is listed on the bottom of the router.\n\nIf you cannot get your Roku Smart Home devices connected, try resetting the Wi-Fi connection by having your phone or tablet \"forget the network\" in the settings menu.

If you have a handheld voice remote such as a Roku Voice Remote or Roku Voice Remote Pro, this article helps you set it up to control your Roku streaming device.\nHow to tell if you have a Roku voice remote\nAll Roku voice remotes have a voice button located near the purple directional pad that has either a microphone icon  (on newer remotes) or a magnifying glass icon  (on older remotes). If your remote has a voice button (as seen below), you have a Roku voice remote. If it does not, you have a Roku simple remote.\n\nTo set up a simple remote, you only need to insert new matching batteries and point the remote at the front of your Roku streaming device.

In fact, if you choose not to pair it during setup, you are not able to complete the setup process unless you also have access to a Roku simple remote. Additionally, failing to pair your voice remote prevents advanced features like voice control from working and may cause button presses to fail periodically.\n\n\nNote:\n\nTo pair a Roku Voice Remote Pro, your Roku streaming device must be running Roku OS 9.4 or higher.\nA Roku Streaming Stick\u00ae cannot be controlled with a Roku simple remote.\n\n\n\nBegin the pairing process when prompted by the on-screen setup instructions from your streaming device. Follow the pairing instructions below for your specific voice remote.\nPair a rechargeable Roku voice remote\nRoku voice remotes with a rechargeable battery, like the Roku Voice Remote Pro, have the pairing button and status light on the back of the remote.

Once you set up your Roku device and voice remote, you can control power on/off and volume for select TV brands and models.\nIf you want to upgrade and have a Roku device that supports a voice remote with TV controls (all models shipped since 2017 are compatible), visit the Roku accessories store and purchase one of the following models:\n\nRoku Voice Remote\nRoku Enhanced Voice Remote\nRoku Voice Remote Pro\n\nFor more help identifying your current remote, learn more about the different types of Roku remotes.\nIf you are planning to purchase a new Roku device, you can use the product comparison chart to determine which current models include a voice remote with TV controls.\nCan I use my Roku remote to control other devices?\nYour Roku voice remote is designed to control power and volume for your TV. It cannot directly control other devices connected to your TV, such as an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar.\nHowever, your TV may be able to issue volume commands to your AVR or soundbar using a technology called HDMI-CEC. In these cases, your Roku voice remote can indirectly control volume for your AVR or soundbar. For this to work, all your devices must be connected via HDMI\u00ae, and all devices must support HDMI-CEC and have this feature enabled. To learn if your TV, AVR or soundbar supports this technology refer to the documentation for each device. Be aware that manufacturers may refer to HDMI-CEC by a different name.\nWhat to know before setting up your voice remote\n\nDuring initial setup and activation, you will be able to set up your voice remote to control power and volume for your TV. You can also set it up later by visiting Settings > Remotes & Devices > Remotes > [select your remote] > Set up remote for TV control.\nDuring the remote setup, your Roku device will attempt to automatically detect the brand of your TV (over the HDMI connection) and program your Roku voice remote. In cases where the brand cannot be detected automatically, you will be taken through a series of steps to manually enter the brand and help program your remote (see setup section below).\nWhen information is gathered via HDMI, often only the brand of the device connected directly to your Roku device can be detected. For this reason, we recommend you always connect your Roku device directly to your TV during setup. If you plan to set up your Roku device for surround sound, temporarily connect your Roku device directly to your TV and complete setup before making any connections to the AVR or soundbar.\n\nHow to set up your voice remote DURING initial setup and activation\nWhen you set up your Roku device for the first time, you will need to connect it to the internet and set the display type before you are presented with the screen to Check remote settings. This is the first step to setting up your remote to control power and volume for your TV.\nBefore you begin, adjust volume on your TV to an audible level. As you make selections, keep your Roku voice remote pointed directly at your TV.\n\nSelect Check remote settings to begin\nWhen you hear music playing, select Yes to confirm. If you do not hear music playing, try increasing volume using your TV remote.\nNext, your Roku device attempts to mute volume using remote codes for the detected TV brand. If the music stops, select Yes.If the music continues to play, select No. Your Roku device was unable to detect the correct information about your TV, however, you can manually enter the brand by selecting Enter TV brand.As you enter the brand using the on-screen keyboard, a list to the right populates. After you select the brand, music begins playing again. Select Yes when you hear it. As before, your Roku device again attempts to mute volume, this time using the first of multiple remote codes for the TV brand you entered. After each code is attempted, you are asked if the music stops playing. When it does, select Yes.\nYour Roku voice remote is now programmed to control both power and volume on your TV. Select OK to continue.\n\n\n\nNote: Your Roku voice remote may not be able to control power and volume on all TV models. With some TV models, you may only be able to control volume, and not power. You should also check that HDMI-CEC is enabled on your TV.\n\nHow to set up your voice remote AFTER initial setup and activation\nAfter your Roku device is activated and set up, you can access the settings menu any time to set up your voice remote to control your TV. If your Roku device is connected to an AVR or soundbar, we recommend temporarily connecting it directly to your TV during setup to successfully detect the brand of your TV.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku voice remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Remote\n\nChoose your voice remote from the list and select Set up remote for TV control\nFollow the on-screen prompts to complete the process\n\nHow to set up hands-free TV controls (Roku Voice Remote Pro only)\nVoice commands are transmitted to your Roku device over a dedicated wireless connection, where they are then passed along to your TV over the HDMI cable. To use hands-free TV controls with your Roku Voice Remote Pro, you need to first make sure CEC is enabled on your TV to allow for this communication. Voice commands cannot be sent using IR technology.\nAfter you confirm CEC is enabled, begin using hands-free voice commands with a simple request such as \"Hey Roku, what time is it?\" and confirm you hear an expected response. Once you know hands-free voice is working, you can use commands like the examples below to control your TV.\n\n\"Hey Roku, turn on the TV\"\n\"Hey Roku, turn up the volume\"\n\"Hey Roku, set the volume to 11\"\n\"Hey Roku, turn off the TV\"\n\nRemember not to speak any slower or louder than you do in a normal conversation and do not overpronounce syllables or words. Speak naturally with a clear and direct \"Hey Roku...\".\n\n\nNote: Not all TV models support CEC, and some may offer limited support. You may find some commands work but not others. Consult your TV manual to understand how CEC works on your TV.\n\nTroubleshooting\nAs described above, your Roku device plays music to help during the setup process. If you do not hear the music or it does not mute correctly, review the troubleshooting steps for setting up your Roku voice remote to control power and volume on your TV.\n", "doc_id": "01c36608-1748-4956-886f-674487131f25", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0602de47d8f9898980a21dcaecb06e540321bd0c3ee7e3af999dbfc60b3c1d9e", "extra_info": {"title": "How to set up your Roku\u00ae voice remote to control your TV | Official Roku Support", "length": 6469, "excerpt": "Learn how to program your compatible Roku voice remote to control volume and power on your TV, and find answers to frequently asked questions.", "byline": "Roku", "dir": null, "lang": "en", "siteName": "Roku"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 6469}, "relationships": {"1": "bfa7d253-1c64-4036-8127-ea92cd92c68e"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c093fd0f-df9c-42fd-9298-1279728a684f": {"text": "    The Roku\u00ae mobile app is a free application for iOS\u00ae and AndroidTM devices that turns your mobile device into the ultimate streaming companion.

Like these smart devices, your Roku\u00ae streaming device also has an operating system that runs software applications, and although uncommon, it too can become unresponsive. Should you find your Roku device in a frozen state or perhaps it is \"stuck at the Roku logo\" on startup, this article helps to rule out an environmental issue before progressing to a system restart, a network reset, and if necessary, a factory reset.\nIf you are simply returning or reselling your Roku device, jump directly to the factory reset steps to clear personal information and get your device back to a state ready for initial setup.

Does video start and stop, or does the image remain completely frozen? Can you control your device sporadically, or not at all? If symptoms come and go, external elements such as the remote, the network, or an HDMI\u00ae cable may be contributing. Efforts should be made to eliminate these possibilities, especially if you continue to see the same intermittent behavior over time.\n\n\nReplace batteries: If at times you are unable to control your Roku device, try installing new matching batteries in the remote. This often-overlooked solution may keep your troubleshooting to a minimum.\n\nCheck network: If you are seeing intermittent playback issues where the image is jerky and pixelated, try streaming video on another smart device on your network (e.g., smartphone, laptop). If you see the behavior on the other device, check out some tips for improving the Wi-Fi\u00ae network connection in your home.\n\nInspect HDMI cable: HDMI cables carry large amounts of data delivering video and audio to other devices. If you notice the picture freezes sporadically or see other video irregularities, try testing with an alternate HDMI cable (at least temporarily). Using quality HDMI cables is important, particularly when setting up a 4K Ultra HD and HDR device with your Roku TV or when connecting your Roku player or Streambar with a 4K TV or an HDR TV.\n\nIf after observing the symptoms, you determine the behavior is constant, a reset method described in the next sections may be necessary. If you have a Roku TV, before you begin, check to see if it responds when using the physical buttons on the TV bezel. If these are not easily visible, feel for the buttons by moving your hand along the top, bottom, and side edges.\nSystem restart your device\nA system restart is the least invasive reset method. If you have a Roku TV, it is not the same as pressing the power button on the remote or the physical power button on the TV itself. Instead, a system restart is performed by removing the power cord from your Roku device for at least 10 seconds before plugging it back in. If reaching the power cord is inconvenient, you can also use the instructions below to perform a system restart from the Settings menu (assuming you can control your Roku device with the remote or the free Roku mobile app for iOS\u00ae or AndroidTM).\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\n\n\nIn either case, your Roku device will complete a system restart and hopefully return to normal operation after a moment. If it does not, continue to the next section.\nReset the network connection\nA network reset is helpful if you experience issues with multiple streaming channels, or if you are using a Roku voice remote and after replacing the batteries, it fails to respond. In either case, if you have a Roku TV, be sure you have tested the physical buttons on the TV and confirmed they are working. A network reset is done from the Settings menu (assuming you can control your device).\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Advanced system settings\n\nSelect Network connection reset\n\nSelect Reset connection\n\n\nAfter the network reset is done, your Roku device will restart and you will need to return to the Settings menu and set up your wireless network again.\nFactory reset your device\nA factory reset clears the majority of data from your Roku device and restores it to a factory default configuration. Specifically, the process will:\n\nErase your personal preferences.\nUnlink your device from your Roku account.\nReset all settings and return your device to a state ready for initial setup.\n\nIf you are able to control your Roku device, you can easily perform a factory reset from the Settings menu. If you cannot control your device or it is completely unresponsive, you can perform a factory reset using the physical Reset button on the device.\nFrom the Settings menu\nPerform the following steps with your Roku remote or the Roku mobile app.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Advanced system settings\n\nSelect Factory reset\n\nIf you have a Roku TV, select Factory reset everything. Otherwise, move to the next step.\nFollow the on-screen instructions\n\nUsing the physical button\nLocated on the back or bottom of your device, the physical Reset button is either tactile or a pinhole design that requires a straightened paperclip. It will appear similar to one of the following:\n\nOnce you locate the Reset button and your Roku device is powered on, press and hold the button firmly for about 10 seconds. When the factory reset is complete, an indicator light or status LED will blink rapidly on most Roku devices.\nAfter a successful factory reset, your Roku device will restart in the same state as a factory-new device, and will be ready for you to complete the following:\n\nPerform the Guided Setup and activation process\n\n\nSign in to streaming channels that require a username and password\nCreate a 4-digit PIN and configure parental control settings\nPerform a broadcast television channel scan (if you have a Roku TV with an HDTV antenna connected)\n\nRecovery mode on a Roku TVIf you have a Roku TV, you can try using Recovery Mode to reinstall the operating system.

For this to work, your Roku device must maintain a good connection to your network and the internet. At any time, you can check the quality of this connection from the Settings menu on your Roku device.\nHow to begin a connection check\nYou can initiate a connection check with the following steps:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings.\nSelect Network\n\nSelect Check connection\n\n\nNote: If your Roku device is not connected to your network, you need to select Set up connection to connect to your network and the internet before you can continue.\n\n\n\nWhat does the connection check do?\nIf you are using a wireless network, your Roku device begins by checking the signal strength of available wireless networks to determine if a better option is available from your router (this is skipped if you are using a wired network). If a stronger wireless signal is detected, you will see an on-screen message suggesting you connect to a recommended network. If the recommended network requires a different password, you will be prompted to enter one.\nNext, your Roku device tries to connect to the wireless or wired network in your home. If successful, your Roku device then attempts to connect to the internet. A green check appears for each successful connection, while a red \u2018x\u2019 appears if a connection cannot be established.\nWhen a green check appears for both connections, your Roku device has successfully connected to your network and the internet. In these cases, your Roku device will also test the strength of each connection and present the results. When the tests for both connections are complete, the connection check ends and you are presented the message, Connection check was successful.\n\nIf either connection tests poorly, an on-screen message presents an error code and a brief list of suggestions to help improve the connection. For help with an error code, learn more about how to resolve connectivity issues.\nReview the connection check results\nYou can access and review the results of the most recent connection check by visiting Settings > Network > About.\n\nIf your Roku device is connected via wireless network, there are two items to check.\n\n\nSignal strength: A measure of the strength of the wireless signal from your router*.\n\nInternet download speed: A measure of the speed of your internet connection. The date of the connection check is also reported.\n\nIf your Roku device has an Ethernet port or it supports a Fast Ethernet adapter and you are using a wired connection, Signal strength will not appear. You will only see results for Internet download speed.\n\nYou can use the product comparison chart to determine which current products have Ethernet.\nWhat do the results mean?\nIf you performed a successful connection check recently, you will see results for Signal strength (for a wireless connection) and Internet download speed. The values of both should be evaluated together to fully understand the quality of your network connection. Each is explained in more detail below.\n\n\nSignal strength\nYou will see one of the values described below:\n\n\n\n\nExcellent: The wireless signal from the router to your Roku device is ideal for streaming.\n\nGood: The wireless signal is strong and suitable for streaming.\n\nFair: The wireless signal is not as strong, but is likely still suitable for streaming.\n\nPoor: The wireless signal is weak which may cause playback issues and/or unpredictable behavior, and may negatively effect internet download speed. Review tips for improving your wireless connection.\n\n\n\nInternet download speed\nYou will see one of the values below:\n\n\n\n\nGood: This likely means your internet connection is functioning without issue, however, you should also review the bandwidth value.\n\nPoor: If Signal strength is Fair, Good or Excellent, make sure no other devices are streaming or downloading large files on your network. You may want to consider contacting your internet service provider, or ISP (usually your cable or phone company), and inquire about upgrading the speed of your internet connection.\n\n\n\nIn addition, you will see the bandwidth of your connection as a result of an end-to-end download test from an internet server to your Roku device, measured in Megabits per second (Mbps). If your internet download speed is consistently greater than the values listed below, you should be able to reliably stream content with the specified resolution on your Roku device.\n\n\n\n\nStandard definition, or SD: You may need 3Mbps or more\n\nHigh definition, or HD: You may need 5Mbps or more\n\n4K Ultra HD, or 4K UHD: You may need up to 25Mbps\n\n8K Ultra HD, or 8K UHD: You may need up to 30Mbps or more\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Each channel may have unique bandwidth requirements. Check with your channel providers for details (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Disney+).\n\n\n\nWhat to do if the connection check shows a red \u2018x\u2019\n\nIf a red \u2018x\u2019 appears for Wireless connection (or Wired connection if your compatible Roku device is connected to a wired network), your Roku device cannot make a connection to your router.Return to the Network menu, select Set up connection, and try again to connect your Roku device to your network.If you are uncertain that you are selecting the correct network, get help finding the wireless network name and password.If you continue to have problems, learn what to do if your Roku device cannot access your home network.\n\n\nIf a red \u2018x\u2019 appears for Internet connection, your Roku device is able to connect to your wireless network, but it is unable to make a connection to the internet.To test the internet connection at your home, use your computer or a mobile device that is connected to your home network and try accessing a public website such as www.roku.com. If you cannot access the internet this way, contact your ISP and inquire about an outage in your area.If you can access the internet from your computer or mobile device, double-check that you are connecting your Roku device to the correct wireless network. If the problem continues, restart your Roku device and the router.\n\nRestarting your Roku device and the router\nIf you continue seeing a red \u2018x\u2019 after trying the suggestions above, try restarting your router and Roku device using the instructions below.\n\n\nRestart your router\nTo restart your router properly, you may need to review instructions from your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. In some cases, you can simply unplug your router and plug it back in, and in other cases it may require pressing a reset button on the device. For help, visit the website for your ISP or router manufacturer, or contact them directly.\nRestart your Roku device\nTo restart your Roku device, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it. Or you can use the following steps to restart it from the Settings menu.\n\n\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet.

This feature allows you to replicate (or \u201cmirror\u201d) the screen of your compatible Android or Windows device wirelessly onto your TV screen. With screen mirroring, you can send web pages, videos, photos, music, and more to your compatible Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TVTM. In other words, whatever you see and do on your mobile device appears on your TV.\nTo use screen mirroring, you must first set up and enable the feature on your Android or Windows device and then request a connection to your Roku device. Once you confirm the request and the connection is established, you can see your mobile screen on your TV and control it from your phone or tablet.\n\nIs screen mirroring supported on my iPhone, iPad, or Mac?\nScreen mirroring as discussed in this article is not supported on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, but a version of screen mirroring is part of Apple AirPlay. AirPlay lets you stream, control, and share content from your iOS\u00ae device to your compatible 4K Roku streaming device. You can watch movies, TV shows, and family videos, listen to popular music, or browse vacation photos.

When casting, you can only watch content available from a mobile app that specifically supports casting. Screen mirroring allows you to view content from any app installed on your mobile device.\n\nWhat you see on your TV. With casting you only see playback of the selected piece of content, whereas with screen mirroring, you see the entire screen of your mobile device including buttons and menus \u2013 every action is mirrored on your TV.\n\nHow you control playback. Casting gives you the option to use your mobile device for control or you can choose to use your Roku remote. During a screen mirroring session, all actions are controlled on your mobile device.\n\nPower state of your phone or tablet. Once playback begins, casting lets you use your mobile device to do something else or you can power it off entirely. Screen mirroring requires that your mobile device remain powered on for the duration of playback.\n\nSupported mobile devices. Casting is supported on most mobile devices \u2013 if you see a casting icon in an app, you may be able to send content to your TV (but not in all cases). Screen mirroring is limited to compatible AndroidTM and Windows\u00ae devices.\n\nTo learn more about directing content from supported mobile apps like YouTube and Netflix to your TV, review the detailed article about casting.\nDoes my Roku device support screen mirroring?\nMost current generation Roku streaming players and Roku TV models support screen mirroring with notable exceptions listed below.

On model 3910, screen mirroring is only supported on the HDMI output, and not on the composite, or A/V output.\n\nYou can use the Roku device comparison chart to determine the current products that support screen mirroring for Android and Windows devices.\nDo I need to enable screen mirroring on my compatible Roku device?If your Roku device supports screen mirroring and is running Roku OS 7.7 or later, the feature is enabled automatically and there is no action required to enable it. To check the software version of your Roku device, go to Settings > System > About. If an older version is installed, connect your Roku device to the internet and have it manually check for a software update.Does my Android device support screen mirroring?\nWith a long list of companies manufacturing Android devices, each with a variety of models, it may be challenging to determine if your Android device supports screen mirroring. In general, if your device is running Android version 10.0 or later (and is not a Google branded device running OS 6.0 or later, like a Google Nexus or Pixel), it likely supports screen mirroring. However, it is not uncommon for manufacturers to use a unique, branded term when describing the feature. To assist with setting up and enabling screen mirroring on your Android device, here are some common terms used on popular devices.\n\nSmart View\nQuick Connect\nSmartShare\nAllShare Cast\nWireless display\nDisplay mirroring\nHTC Connect\nScreen casting\nCast\n\nIf you cannot easily determine the term for your device or you are not certain your device supports screen mirroring, refer to the manufacturer's website or contact them directly.

When you want to stop using screen mirroring, you can simply press Home  on your Roku remote and continue using your devices as you normally would. You can also deselect or disconnect your Roku device from the screen mirroring menu on your Android or Windows device to stop the connection.\nWhat screen mirroring settings to adjust\nYou can define how an incoming screen mirroring request is handled by changing the screen mirroring mode on your Roku device. You can also remove a device that was added to the list of \u2018Allowed devices\u2019 or \u2018Blocked devices\u2019.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nSelect Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Screen mirroring\n\nAfter you open the screen mirroring settings, choose a setting to adjust.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen mirroring mode \u2013 Select one of the choices to define how an incoming screen mirroring request is handled.\n\n\nPrompt \u2013 Each time a screen mirroring request is made, your Roku device will display an on-screen prompt, except in the case where \u2018Always accept\u2019 was selected from the prompt for a specific device.\n\nAlways allow \u2013 A request from any device to mirror or cast its screen will be accepted without an on-screen prompt appearing.\n\nNever allow \u2013 Always blocks a screen mirroring request from any device without an on-screen prompt appearing.

This feature allows you to replicate (or \u201cmirror\u201d) the screen of your compatible Android or Windows device wirelessly onto your TV screen. With screen mirroring, you can send web pages, videos, photos, music, and more to your compatible Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TVTM. In other words, whatever you see and do on your mobile device appears on your TV.\nTo use screen mirroring, you must first set up and enable the feature on your Android or Windows device and then request a connection to your Roku device. Once you confirm the request and the connection is established, you can see your mobile screen on your TV and control it from your phone or tablet.\n\n", "doc_id": "55624bbd-7337-4621-8587-73a8b8b6ae98", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "740a670b5e9514ba1d864c36620454929d7db107d4d8845b568a2bc914d43edf", "extra_info": {"title": "How to screen mirror your Android\u2122\u00a0or Windows\u00ae\u00a0phone to your Roku\u00ae streaming device | Official Roku Support", "length": 11151, "excerpt": "If you wonder how to screen mirror on a Roku device, use the screen mirroring steps below to display content from your Android or Windows phone on a nearby TV.", "byline": "Roku", "dir": null, "lang": "en", "siteName": "Roku"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 11155}, "relationships": {"1": "a67dc0af-59b4-430b-ba37-19a5cc2f360e"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53b07ee3-b07e-4251-aaae-1e49e837d4e0": {"text": "Depending on which Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TVTM you own, you will have one of two general types of remote:\n\nRoku simple remote\nRoku voice remote\n\nIf you already own a Roku streaming device, you can find guidelines in this article to help identify the voice button and use that information to determine the general type of remote you own. You can also learn about features available on the current offering of Roku voice remotes.\nIf you are looking to purchase a new Roku streaming device, visit the product comparison chart to learn about the remotes included in the current lineup.\nWhat is a voice button?\nAll Roku voice remotes have a voice button located near the purple directional pad that has either a microphone icon  (on newer remotes) or a magnifying glass icon  (on older remotes). If your remote has a voice button (as seen below), you have a Roku voice remote. If it does not, you have a Roku simple remote.\n\nWhat is a Roku simple remote?\nA Roku simple remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to transmit button presses a short distance. For a simple remote to operate reliably, it must be pointed directly at the Roku streaming device (it is controlling) and there must be nothing that could block the signal from travelling to the front of that device (where the IR receiver is located).\nRoku simple remotes include the buttons seen in the example below including channel shortcut buttons that let you launch popular streaming channels with a single press.\n\nA simple remote is included with many Roku TV models and some streaming players such as the current generation Roku Express and Roku Premiere. The simple remote included with a Roku TV has all the buttons seen on a player remote (like the example above), along with buttons to control power and volume on the TV.\nTo set up a simple remote, you only need to insert new matching batteries and point the remote at the front of your Roku device. For more help, learn how to resolve issues with your simple remote.\nWhat is a Roku voice remote?\nA Roku voice remote connects over a wireless network and does not need to be pointed directly at your Roku streaming player or Roku TV when pressing buttons. This allows you to install your Roku streaming player behind a wall-mounted TV or another nearby, out-of-sight location. Voice remotes will either have a pairing button or a button combination to initiate the pairing process and establish the dedicated wireless connection with your Roku streaming device. You can learn more about how to set up or pair your Roku voice remote. \nVoice remotes have the same buttons you find on a simple remote, along with the voice button mentioned above that allows you to use push-to-talk voice to search and control your Roku device. Simply press and hold the button and say a command like \"search for comedies\" or \"launch The Roku Channel\" in a conversational tone at normal volume. After you release the button, your streaming  device will carry out your request, delivering you to the Roku Search screen or elsewhere within the Roku interface.\nWhat other features are available on Roku voice remotes?\nIn addition to push-to-talk voice, different Roku voice remote models offer the following features which may or may not be included on your remote:\n\n\nTV controls: Use dedicated buttons to control power and volume on your TV with a single remote. Some voice remotes also have a dedicated mute button.\n\nPrivate listening: When you do not want to disturb others nearby, plug your headphones into the audio jack on the side of your voice remote and listen to your favorite entertainment while the speakers in the TV mute automatically. Use the buttons on the side of your remote to adjust volume and unplug your headphones when you want to turn off the feature.\n\nPersonal shortcuts: Create a personal shortcut and with the press of a single button, you can launch a popular streaming channel, open the Live TV guide, issue an often-used voice command, and more. Simply press and hold the '1' or '2' button for 5 seconds to create your first personal shortcut.\n\nLost remote finder: A built-in speaker in your remote plays a sound when you trigger the feature from your Roku streaming device or the free Roku mobile app. If your remote also supports hands-free voice, you can say \u201cHey Roku, where\u2019s my remote?\u201d and it will play a sound letting you quickly find it.\n\nHands-free voice: Use voice commands without pushing a button or handling your voice remote. Simply move the slider to 'green' to turn on hands-free voice, keep the remote nearby, and say a command like \"Hey Roku, turn captions on\", \"Hey Roku, show me the news\", or \"Hey Roku, pause\".\n\nRechargeable battery: When on-screen messaging lets you know the rechargeable battery is getting low on power, you can easily and quickly charge your remote with a standard USB power adapter (like the one you use to charge your smartphone).\n\nWhat features does my Roku voice remote include?\nThe Roku voice remotes listed below are the models in current production. If your voice remote does not match one of these current models, it is likely an older voice remote and may have a different set of features. Fortunately, current models are compatible with the majority of older Roku streaming devices.

This newer standard enables 4K playback at 60fps with HDR color such as HDR10 and Dolby VisionTM as well.\nWhat HDMI settings to adjust on your TV\nIncorrect HDMI settings on your TV or an incompatible HDMI port may cause your streaming player to only play 1080p even when your TV is capable of 4K HDR or 4K Dolby Vision. If you are using an HDMI port that does not support Dolby Vision at 60fps, this cannot be fixed from the TV settings. Try using a different HDMI port and make sure it is enabled for HDMI 2.0 mode or later\nIf your Roku player is connected directly to your TV, you only need to be concerned about adjusting the HDMI settings on your TV. If it is connected to an AVR or soundbar that connects to your TV, you may need to adjust the HDMI settings on both your AVR or soundbar and TV. To simplify troubleshooting, it is best to temporarily connect your Roku player directly to your TV and adjust the HDMI settings for your TV first. Note that the HDR settings on some TVs are specific to each HDMI input. Please make sure to change the settings specific to the HDMI input where your Roku player is connected.\n\nChange HDMI settings on your TV\nTo preserve compatibility with early HDR devices, many TVs are factory-configured to use HDMI 1.4 mode, limiting HDR playback to 30 frames per second. You should go to the settings menu on your TV and enable HDMI 2.0 mode or later on the specific input you are using.\nYou can refer to the sample instructions that accompany the popular TV brands below, but steps may vary from model to model, and may change when TV software is updated.

Some models limit 4K support to 30fps on certain ports, specifically HDMI ports located on the front panel of an AVR. If you have an older AVR or soundbar and you are not sure it supports HDMI 2.0 mode, you can connect your Roku player directly to your TV and then connect your AVR or soundbar separately to the HDMI ARC (or eARC) port on your TV.\nA note on HDMI cables\nRoku players that support HDR ship with an HDMI 2.0 compatible cable. If you cannot use the included cable, be sure to purchase a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable. The typically more expensive Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is a good choice for reducing potential Wi-Fi\u00ae and Bluetooth\u00ae interference, or for future-proofing an installation where the cable location is in an otherwise inaccessible area. Cables that are not labeled or may be labeled \"high speed\" or \"standard speed\" may not be adequate for 4K HDR10, HDR10+, or Dolby Vision content at 60fps.\nIf your Roku player is connected to an AVR or soundbar, make sure all cables are HDMI 2.0 compatible. If you see a black screen or poor performance and video degradation with a 4K HDR signal, replace any older cables with a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable.Read more backgroundTo preserve compatibility with early Ultra HD Blu-rayTM players, many 4K TVs are factory-configured to use HDMI\u00ae 1.4 mode, limiting 4K Ultra HD (4K) with High Dynamic Range (HDR) playback to 30 frames per second (fps).

It is important that a connection between your Roku device, your home network, and the internet is established in order to stream audio and video. Determine if your Roku device supports a wired or wireless connection using the product comparison chart.\nSome TVs powered by Roku OS require an internet connection to complete set up. This will allow the latest software updates to be delivered to your TV in order to provide you with the best smart TV experience by ensuring you have the latest features, programming, and fixes. After setup, your TV can be used without an internet connection, but will be limited to playing content from HDMI sources, cable, or over-the-air broadcasts.\nOnce you know how to connect your Roku device to the internet, you can begin to set up your device with the on-screen process known as Guided Setup. During the Guided Setup you will configure your preferences, your settings, and activate your device. If you have trouble connecting your Roku streaming device to the internet, simple troubleshooting steps can help to ensure you are able to complete the setup process.\nHow to connect your Roku streaming device to the internet\nIf you are connecting your Roku streaming device to Wi-Fi, be sure to have your wireless network name, sometimes known as the SSID, and the network password on hand. Keep in mind when entering your password, that passwords are often case-sensitive. Use the shift button on the on-screen keyboard to enter a capital letter if you need to. Additional assistance is available if you need support locating your wireless network name and password. If you are connecting to public network that requires signing in through a web browser, learn how to use Hotel and Dorm Connect to connect to the internet.\nIf you are using a wired network connection, attach one end of the network cable to the Ethernet port on your compatible Roku device, and the other end directly to your router. If your Roku device does not have an Ethernet port, learn more about how to connect to the internet using a third-party adapter.\nDuring Guided Setup, you will be asked to do the following:\n\nSelect Wired for Ethernet cable connections or Wireless for Wi-Fi connections.\nIf you select Wired, your Roku device will automatically connect to your home network and the internet. If you select Wireless, continue to the next step.\nSelect your wireless network from the list of available Wi-Fi networks. If you do not see your network, select Scan again to see all networks.\nEnter your network password. To see the password as you type, choose Show password.\nSelect Connect\n\n\nOnce you have selected your network and entered your password properly, your Roku streaming device will connect to your home network and the internet. After your successful connection, the latest version of software will begin to automatically download if an update is available for your Roku device. Once the software update has been installed, your device will restart. If you are having difficulty making a connection, please review the troubleshooting steps below to solve common network connection issues.\nHow to update your network settings\nIf a connection to the internet was not established during Guided Setup or your network changed and you need to update the connection, access the Settings menu on your Roku device using the instructions below:\n\nPress Home  on your remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Network\n\nSelect Set up connection\n\nChoose Wired or Wireless\n\nIf you select Wired, your Roku device will automatically connect to your network and the internet. If you select Wireless, continue to the next step.\nSelect your network from the list of available networks. If you do not see your network, select Scan again to see all networks.\nEnter your network password. To see the password as you type, choose Show password.\nSelect Connect\n\n\nCommon network connection troubleshooting steps\nIf you are less familiar with how Roku streaming devices connect to the internet, we recommend that you review the steps above on how to update network settings and confirm that you are properly connected to the internet before you troubleshoot, if you have not already.\nIf you are having issues with your network connection, begin troubleshooting by following our detailed article on how to check the connection to your home network and internet. The steps in that article will help you diagnose potential issues with existing network connections. Once you have checked your Roku streaming device and the internet connection, use the steps below to ensure that your connections are working properly:\n\n\nSelect your wireless network and enter the password correctly. Keep in mind that network passwords are case sensitive. Use the shift button on the on-screen keyboard to enter a capital letter. You can get additional help if you need to find your wireless password and network name.\n\nEnsure your router is working properly. If you can connect to the internet from another device, such as your computer or phone, your router is successfully providing internet access and you can move to the next step. If you are unable to connect to the internet, try restarting your router.\n\nImprove the strength of your wireless signal. If resetting your router does not improve your connection, the issue may be the strength of the wireless signal. The farther your Roku device is from your router, the weaker your wireless signal. There are several tips to help improve your wireless signal.\n\nTry an Ethernet cable, or a third-party adapter. If establishing a wireless connection is difficult, an Ethernet cable will provide a faster, more reliable connection. All Roku streaming devices have the ability to connect to a router via wireless. Some Roku streaming devices also have an Ethernet port, or use a third-party adapter to connect to the internet. If your Roku device does not have an Ethernet port, learn more about how to connect to the internet using a third-party adapter.\n\nRestart your router. To restart your router, check the instructions from your Internet Service Provider or router vendor. In some cases, you can simply unplug it and plug it back in. Other cases may require pressing a reset button on the device.\n\nRestart your Roku device. To restart your device, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it. Or you can follow the steps below and restart it from the Settings menu.\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\n\n\n\n\nConnect to a mobile hotspot\nIf you are unable to connect your streaming device to the internet, you may be able to connect to a hotspot using your mobile device. A hotspot might be helpful if you have a temporary network outage or your streaming device is outside of Wi-Fi range and need to set up a TV powered by Roku OS. After set up is complete, you can turn off the hotspot and use your TV for non-streaming activities such as connecting a gaming console, DVD player, or Live TV antenna.\nHotspot capability is dependent on your mobile device and mobile service provider. Downloading updates for your streaming device can consume large amounts of data. Refer to your service provider for your data limits and hotspot policy.\nFollow the hotspot set up instructions for your phone and then refer to the instructions in the section above to find and connect to your phone's hotspot network:\n\nIf you have an iOS\u00ae device, refer to Apple's documentation on setting up a personal hotspot.\n\nIf you have a AndroidTM device, refer to Google's documentation on sharing a mobile connection by hotspot.\n\n\nCommon connection error screens and recommended actions\nIf your Roku device is unable to connect to your router and gain access to the internet, you may see one of the following error messages.\n\n\nUnable to connect to wireless network. This screen may appear when you are initially trying to connect your Roku streaming device to your wireless network during Guided Setup. Follow the on-screen suggestions.\n\n\n\nChecking wireless connection. This screen may appear on your Roku device after you have entered the Wi-Fi network name and password. If your connection is not successful, you will see a red x as pictured below.\n\n\n\nNot connected to the internet. This screen appears if the network or internet connection is lost when trying to launch a streaming channel. Keep in mind that most channels require a reliable internet connection or you may experience interruptions when streaming.\n\n\n\nLoading, please wait. This screen appears when the network or internet connection is lost during playback.\n\n\n\nCommon connection error codes and recommended actions\nIf you see one of the following error codes on your screen, take the recommended action to troubleshoot your network connection.\nPassword issues. Re-enter your password.\n\nError code 14.40\nError code 14.41\n\nWi-Fi signal strength issues. Move your Roku device closer to your wireless router.\n\nError code 14.20\nError code 14.62\nError code 14.64\nError code 016\nError code 017\n\nEthernet cable related issues. Unplug your Ethernet cable then plug it back in, or try a different one.\n\nError code 012\nError code 013\n\nSlow internet speed issues. You may want to consider upgrading your internet to a faster connection.\n\nError code 018\n\nConnectivity issues. Restart your router and Roku device.\n\nError code 009\nError code 14\nError code 14.10\nError code 14.11\nError code 14.30\nError code 14.50\nError code 14.62\nError code 14.64\n\nPro tips\nIf you are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network: If your router and Roku device both support 5GHz, make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network.\n\n\nNote: Not all Roku devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the wireless channel: When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\n\n\n\nIf your Roku device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network: Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your Roku device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common. Additionally, if your 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless networks have different network names, your Roku device will only be able to connect to the 2.4GHz wireless network.To optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your Roku device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\nMove the router farther away: If your router is close to your Roku device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your Roku device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.\n\nRead more backgroundWhen you turn on your Roku\u00ae streaming player or TV powered by Roku OS for the first time, your device will automatically prompt you to establish a connection to the internet over Wi-Fi\u00ae or Ethernet cable.

If you encounter any issues during setup, there are a number of suggestions for you to try below.\nIf you are not sure that your voice remote has TV controls, read more about the different types of Roku remotes.\nWhy do I not hear music during setup?\nIf during the setup process you cannot hear the music playing after increasing volume using the TV remote (with fresh batteries), check the following:\n\nMake sure all devices connected to your Roku device support audio over HDMI. For example, many overhead projectors do not have speakers.\n\nWhy am I unable to mute the music with my Roku voice remote?\nWhen the music cannot be muted during setup, the on-screen menu prompts you to enter the brand of your TV and try setup again. If you still are unable to get your Roku voice remote programmed with this method, take note of the following:\n\nCheck for any obstructions between your remote and the IR receiver on front of your TV (commonly located along the bottom edge of the bezel). To mute the music, your remote needs direct line of sight to this sensor. If you cannot locate the IR receiver on your TV, refer to the manufacturer's online documentation or contact them directly.\nLimit the number of devices connected between your Roku device and the TV. Removing a device, even if done temporarily, may confirm that the device is causing the behavior. You may even be able to setup your voice remote with the device removed, and have it continue to work after reconnecting the device.\nCertain television brands such as Bang & Olufsen may not be supported.\n\nWhy is my Roku voice remote able to control TV power or volume, but not both?\nWith manufacturers producing various models, most TV brands have a number of remote codes. During the remote setup, your Roku device will attempt to narrow this list of possible codes on your specific TV brand and program your voice remote to the correct code. It is possible that the code programmed into your voice remote when you heard the music stop only contains commands to control either power or volume, but not both. Using a different code for the TV brand may work to control both power and volume.To have your Roku device try additional remote codes, restart the TV controls setup process for your voice remote and alter the steps as follows:\n\nWhen you first hear the music stop and are asked \u201cDid the music stop playing?\u201d, do not answer the question. Instead, turn volume back up with your TV remote until the music is audible again.\nNow, answer the question with No and your Roku device will move on to try the next remote code.\nThe next time you hear the music stop, answer the question with Yes and your voice remote will be programmed with the new code.\nIn rare cases, you may need to repeat this process, answering No to multiple codes before you find a code that controls both power and volume.\n\nWhy do the power and volume buttons only work sometimes?\nThere are two ways your Roku voice remote can send commands to your TV.\n\n\nInfrared (or IR): As mentioned earlier, IR technology requires you point your remote directly at your TV for each button press. Any obstruction (even a partial one) can cause button presses to be missed.\n\nHDMI-CEC: Also known as just CEC, this technology uses the HDMI connection to pass along power and volume commands your Roku player receives from your remote. With CEC, you can point your remote in any direction since it communicates with your Roku player over a direct wireless connection.\n\nIf you find that the power and volume buttons only work sometimes, it is likely that your remote is using IR to send these commands to your TV. To confirm this is the case, first make sure you can adjust volume when pointing your remote directly at your TV. Next, cup your hand over the front of your remote, then point it away from your TV and try again. If volume cannot be adjusted using this test, your remote is using IR.\nYou can use the steps below to get your remote to switch to using CEC.\n\nCheck that CEC is enabled on your TV.\nGo to the Settings menu on your Roku player and redo the TV controls setup for your remote.\n\n\n\nNote: Not all TV models support CEC, and some may only support power and not volume. Consult your TV manual for more information.\n\nWhat to do if the power and volume buttons stop working\nIf the power and volume buttons on your remote have stopped working entirely, try to update your Roku device to the most recent software. To manually update your software:\n\nNavigate to Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect System update\n\nSelect Check now\n\n\nConfirm the dialogue box to proceed with download and and installation. Note that your Roku player will automatically download the latest software the next time when it checks for update. After the Roku player finishes restarting, if TV control has not been restored, setup your remote for TV control again by doing the following:\n\nNavigate to Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Remotes followed by your remote\nSelect Set up remote for TV control\n\n\nOur FAQ provides additional information and complete steps on how to set up your voice remote to control your TV.\nWhy does TV power and volume not work when I use a voice command?\nWhen you use a push-to-talk voice command like \"turn off the TV\" or a hands-free voice command like \"Hey Roku, turn off the TV\", the command is relayed over the HDMI connection to your TV using CEC. If CEC is not enabled or your TV does not support it, the voice command will not work even if pressing the power and volume buttons on your remote does work (this is because your remote can also use IR to send these commands as described in the previous section).\nTo fix the issue, go to the settings on your TV and make sure CEC is enabled.\n\n\nNote: Not all TV models support CEC, and some may only support power and not volume. Consult your TV manual for more information.\n\nFor more help using push-to-talk or hands-free voice commands, check out the detailed article about using your voice to search and control your Roku device.\nWarm or hot to touch\nIf the back of your Roku remote gets warm or hot during normal use, the rechargeable battery may be damaged or the alkaline batteries may be corroded.\n\nDiscontinue use of your remote.\nDisconnect your rechargeable remote from the charging cable.\nPlace remote on a hard non-flammable surface (like tile) and let it cool. Do not attempt to remove the alkaline batteries while hot!\n\n\nRead more backgroundSome Roku voice remotes incorporate both wireless and infrared (IR) technologies letting you seamlessly control your Roku streaming device along with aspects of your TV.

This document describes the basic setup instructions you can use for any Roku player or Streaming Stick. If you have a Roku TVTM and need help, visit the dedicated setup article for setting up a Roku TV.\nKeep in mind that if your Roku player or Streaming Stick supports 4K Ultra HD (4K) or High Dynamic Range (HDR), you will not be able to take advantage of 4K without a 4K-compatible TV, or HDR without an HDR-compatible TV. In addition to a compatible TV, there are other requirements you should be aware of when setting up your Roku device for 4K or setting it up for HDR.\nIf you prefer a more tailored set of instructions, you can visit the setup article specific to the current-generation models listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoku Express\nRoku Express 4K\nRoku Express 4K+\nRoku Ultra\n\n\n\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K+\n\nRoku Streambar\u00ae\n\nRoku Streambar Pro\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to connect your Roku device to a TVYour Roku streaming device can be connected to any television with an HDMI\u00ae port. To make this connection, a Roku player requires an HDMI cable while a Roku Streaming Stick connects directly with its built-in HDMI connector. When selecting an HDMI cable, we recommend that you use a High Speed HDMI Cable if your TV only supports 720p and 1080p, or a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable if your TV also supports 4K Ultra HD or HDR.What if my TV does not have an HDMI port?\nCurrent-generation Roku players must be connected to a TV with an HDMI port. However, if you have an older television that does not support HDMI and an older Roku player with a composite audio/video connection, you can connect your player to your TV to stream your favorite entertainment.\n\n\n\nTo determine if your player has a composite connection, look for a single port labeled \"A/V\" or \"A/V OUT\", or you may see a separate port labeled \"VIDEO\" along with two ports labeled \"AUDIO\". The cable you need to connect your player to your TV likely has red, white, and yellow connectors like those seen here.\n\n\n\n\nHook up your Roku device\nUse the steps below to connect your Roku streaming player or Roku Streaming Stick and prepare it for on-screen setup and activation.\n1. Connect your Roku device to your TV\n\n\nUsing HDMI\nConnect your Roku player using the correct HDMI cable, or connect your Streaming Stick directly\n\n\n\nNote: Your Roku player or Streaming Stick may differ from those depicted in the sample diagrams here.\n\nIf you plan to stream 4K or HDR content, you must connect your compatible Roku device to an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2. Learn what to look for if you need help identifying an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2.\n\n\nNote: If your Roku Streaming Stick does not easily connect to the HDMI input on your TV due to space restrictions, you may wish to get a free HDMI extender cable.\n\nUsing composite\nIf your TV does not have an HDMI port, connect your compatible Roku player using composite cables.\n\n\n\n2. Connect your Roku player to your wired network (optional)\n\n\nIf you are using a wired network and your Roku player has an Ethernet port, connect one end of an Ethernet cable to your player and the other end to an available Ethernet port on your router or network switch.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nSome Roku players without an Ethernet port support a wired network connection using a compatible third-party Ethernet adapter.\nA Roku Streaming Stick does not have an Ethernet port.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Connect your Roku device to power\n\n\nFrom a wall outlet (recommended)\nUse the power adaptor (or USB power cable and power adaptor) to connect your Roku streaming device to a wall outlet.\n\n\n\nNote: If you are connecting a Roku Streaming Stick 4K or Roku Streaming Stick 4K+, you must connect the USB power cable with long-range Wi-Fi receiver to the power adaptor. For details, refer to the setup article that explains how to connect the long-range Wi-Fi receiver.\n\nFrom a USB port on your TV\nAny Roku Streaming Stick supports USB power, but only some Roku players do. If you are connecting your Roku device to USB power, use the USB power cable to connect it to a USB port on your TV.\n\n\n\nNote: The USB port on some TV\u2019s may be unable to power a Roku device. If you see the on-screen warning message that appears in these cases, use the power adaptor (or USB power cable and power adaptor) and connect to a wall outlet.\n\n\n\n4. Power on your TV and select the correct input\n\n\nUse your TV remote to power on your television and select the input where you connected your Roku device. You should see the Roku logo on the TV screen as your Roku device powers on. Help is available if you do not see any picture on your TV.\n\n\n5. Set up your Roku remote\n\n\nThere are two types of Roku remotes \u2013 a simple remote and voice remote. If you are not sure what type you have, you can check for a voice  button since only voice remotes have one.\nIf you have a Roku simple remote, be aware that it sends commands using infrared (IR) light and must be pointed directly at your player when pressing buttons. To begin using it, simply slide open the battery cover and insert fresh, matching batteries. Help is available if you have issues using your Roku simple remote.\n\nIf you have a Roku voice remote, it sends commands over a direct wireless connection that your Roku player creates using a discovery process called pairing. To assist with this process, you must put your voice remote into \"pairing mode\" using the method below that matches the type of battery in your remote.\n\n\n\nRechargeable battery: Some voice remotes, such as the Roku Voice Remote Pro have a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. To get this type of remote into pairing mode, press and hold the pairing button for 5 seconds until the status light turns green and starts flashing.\n\n\nStandard batteries: Other voice remotes use standard alkaline batteries just like a Roku simple remote. If your remote has batteries pre-installed and a battery pull-tab, pull the tab to power on the remote. If your remote does not come with batteries pre-installed, slide open the battery cover and insert fresh, matching batteries. Your remote will enter pairing mode once it receives power. \n\n\nOnce your voice remote is in pairing mode, your Roku player will complete the pairing process automatically. Help is available if you have problems pairing your Roku voice remote or if you need more detailed remote pairing instructions. \n\n\nOn-screen setup and activation\nA welcome screen will appear after you switch your TV input to where your streaming device is connected. During setup, you will choose a language, connect to the internet, download the latest updates, configure display settings, and finally activate your Roku streaming device. You must create or use an existing Roku account and then activate and link your device using an activation link sent to your email or accessed with a QR code. Learn how to enable the text-to-speech screen reader, if you need audial assistance navigating through setup.\nChoose a language\nThe first screen you see will allow you to choose a language. Scroll through the list and press OK  on your Roku remote to choose a language. All text and dialog within the Roku interface will be displayed in the selected language.\n\n\nNote: It is the responsibility of the channel publisher to translate their channel and some channels may not support your chosen language.\n\nConnect to the internet\nIf you are using a wired network, make sure an Ethernet cable is connected to your Roku streaming device (if it has an Ethernet port) or a compatible Ethernet adapter (if your device has a USB or micro USB port and supports a third-party adapter) and select Wired. Otherwise, select Wireless and use the guidelines below to set up the wireless connection.\nChoose your wireless network from the list of available networks and enter your password. This is often the same network you use to connect your computer or smartphone to the internet. If you do not see your network, select Scan again to see all networks. For more assistance, see help finding your wireless network and password.\nIf you want to see your password as you type, choose Show password. This can help prevent entering the wrong password. Remember, passwords are case-sensitive. Use the shift button  on the on-screen keyboard to enter a capital letter.\nOnce you enter your password and select Connect, your device will automatically connect to the internet. Alternatively, you can get more help if you are unable to connect to your wireless network.\nDownload the latest updates\nOnce connected to the internet, your streaming device will check to see if there is a software update available, download the latest version if necessary, and automatically reboot after updating.\nConfigure display settings\nSelect Set display type and let your streaming device auto detect the best display resolution so you do not have to manually configure the settings. To change the display type at a later time, go to Settings > Display type.\nIf support for 4K or HDR is not detected on your compatible Roku device, and you are using a compatible TV, make sure all HDMI cables are firmly attached and all connections support HDCP 2.2. For more help, review the steps for 4K setup or HDR setup.\n\n\nNote: This step may be done automatically by your device. If this step is not shown during setup, your device was able to do this step automatically for you.\n\nSet up your Roku voice remote to control your TV\nSelect Check remote settings to automatically set up your Roku voice remote to control the power and volume for your TV. If you skip this step, you can set up your remote for TV control at any time from the Settings menu. Simply go to Settings > Remotes & devices > Remotes > [select your remote] > Set up remote for TV control. A Roku voice remote may not be able to control volume and power on all TV models. With some TV models, you may only be able to control the volume, and not the power.\n\n\nNote: This setup step only appears if you are using a Roku voice remote with TV controls. Certain Roku devices released in 2017 and later include this remote, or you can purchase one from the Roku accessories store.\n\nCreate a Roku account and activate your device\nWhen prompted on screen, you will need to perform the following steps to create your Roku account and complete device activation. It may take a few moments to receive the activation email from Roku. If you do not see it in your email inbox, be sure to check your spam (or junk) folder.\n\n\nPress OK  on your remote to reveal the on-screen keyboard.\n\n\nUsing your remote, type a valid email address. If you have a voice remote, you can press and hold the voice  button and say your email address instead.\n\n\nImportant: This email will also be used as your Roku login, which is important for managing your Roku account and device services.\n\n\nIf you have trouble receiving the activation link in your email, press Star  on your remote and try again or select Activate with a QR Code option. Use your mobile phone's camera to scan the QR code and get the device activation link.\nOnce you open the link, either from the email or QR code, follow the instructions for creating a Roku account and setting up your Roku device with channels to watch.\n\nIf you cannot get your Roku device activated, learn how to resolve linking issues. Roku does not require an activation fee, or charge for support of any kind. Learn how to avoid fraudulent websites.\nEnjoy your Roku device!\nWith all steps complete, your Roku streaming device is ready to use. You can personalize your device by changing your theme pack or screensaver and you can use the Roku Channel Store to add new streaming channels, games, and other apps.\nWhy is the image not in HDR or the picture quality poor when watching HDR content?\nWhen you specifically watch an HDR movie or TV show on your HDR-capable Roku device, you may notice the image is not displayed in HDR, or the picture quality is poor. If you encounter this behavior, you may need to update the software on your HDR-capable TV. You can typically find instructions how to do this along with the latest software on the TV manufacturer\u2019s website. Once you confirm that your TV is running the latest software, check that it is properly configured to enable HDR on the specific input to which your Roku player is connected. Some TVs that support HDR do not enable this feature by default.\n", "doc_id": "ec9ade97-f8e3-45a9-98d0-63f11d810cfa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fb15fa3cc645d2ad70ce00282f5f513aa22d1c195c3f132aef32868a95c1e965", "extra_info": {"title": "How to set up your Roku streaming player or Streaming Stick (any model) | Official Roku Support", "length": 12487, "excerpt": "When you want to hook up Roku to your TV, read the setup instructions and learn how to connect and set up a Roku streaming player or Roku Streaming Stick.", "byline": "Roku", "dir": null, "lang": "en", "siteName": "Roku"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 12488}, "relationships": {"1": "4ac36001-84bb-4662-a952-a0cc4ba40553"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed2e0b46-9c8c-4eec-b9bc-69f02f48bac0": {"text": "This article is for users who can power on their Roku player, but cannot see the picture on their TV. If your player will not power on or you do not hear sound, review the suggestions in the appropriate article below:\n\nWhat to do if you cannot hear sound from your Roku player\nWhat to do if your Roku player will not power on\n\nWhat should I do?\nMake sure your Roku player is connected directly to the TV. If you have the Roku player connected to an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar, then first disconnect it and connect directly to the TV. This will remove any issue with the AVR or soundbar and make it easier to troubleshoot the problem.\nFirst, make sure the TV is turned on and press a button on the Roku remote control to ensure that the Roku device is not in standby or screensaver mode.\nThese are the most common reasons you may not see the picture on your TV:\n\n\nYou have the wrong input (source) selected on your TV\n\nThis is extremely common and an easy mistake to make. Most TV\u2019s have several video inputs on the back or side of the TV that are used for connecting different devices such as a cable box, gaming console, and of course, Roku player. You must select the input (sometimes referred to as source) that matches the one to which you have the Roku player connected.\n\nLook to see which input you have the Roku player connected; the video connector will be labelled with the input name; e.g. HDMI 1, HDMI 2, AUX, VIDEO IN 1, etc.\n\n\nThe way you change inputs can be different based on the brand of TV and model, but it is usually accessible from a button on the TV's remote control. If you can, check the instructions that came with your television, or try the following:\n\nLook for a button on your TV remote control that says Input, Source, AUX, Video, TV/Video or something similar. Press this button. Depending on your TV, pressing the button may cycle through available inputs, or it may display a menu with a choice of inputs.\n\nIf it cycles through the inputs - wait 10 seconds between button presses to allow the TV to detect the video.\n\nIf a menu is displayed - use the arrow buttons on the TV remote to choose the right input and then press the Enter or Select Alternatively, select each input one at a time. Wait 10 seconds between each to allow the TV to detect the video.\nIn both cases, if no video is detected on the input, then the TV will usual show a message such as \u201cNo video\u201d or \u201cNo signal detected\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video cable is not connected properly or the cable is faulty\n\nCheck that the video cable is firmly connected to the back of your Roku player and to the HDMI or composite connector on the TV. If you have a Roku Streaming Stick, then make sure it is firmly connected to the HDMI connector on your TV.\nIf you can, check to see if you have a faulty cable by connecting your Roku player with a different cable.\n\n\n\nThere is a problem with the TV\n\nIf you can, try connecting the Roku player to a different input on the TV to see if the problem is with connector on the TV.\nIf you can, try connecting the Roku player to a different television to see if the problem is with your Roku player or the TV.\n\n\n\nEnable CEC or disable auto power savings\n\nIf you do not see a picture after pressing a button on your Roku remote, it is possible that your player cannot \"wake up\" your TV over the HDMI connection. To fix this, make sure that HDMI-CEC is enabled on your TV. If you prefer your player never enters the low power mode, you can disable auto power savings.\n\n\n\nThere is a problem with the USB power adaptor, or the adaptor does not meet requirements\n\nIt is possible your Roku player is not receiving enough power, even if the power light is on. This happens sometimes if you connect your Roku player through a third-party device with a USB/AC power adaptor that does not meet more recent USB standards. Try a different power adaptor or try plugging your Roku player directly into a power source. For more information, learn what to do if the red light is flashing or you see a \"low-power\" warning.\n\n\n\nIf all else fails...\n\nDisconnect and reconnect all cables including the power cable.\n\n\n\nIf you are connected to a television or AVR capable of displaying 4K\nIf you are connected to a television or AVR that it is capable of displaying 4K resolution, then you may wish to check how to setup your Roku streaming player for 4K.Last updated on 8/18/2022, 11:14:18 AMWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "ed2e0b46-9c8c-4eec-b9bc-69f02f48bac0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "02245f369916dc8c8694f8f0414dc5cc3f1cef71772155ec333e83c7a711e677", "extra_info": {"title": "What to do if you cannot see the picture from your Roku\u00ae streaming player on your TV | Official Roku Support", "length": 4422, "excerpt": "This article is for users who can power on their Roku player, but cannot see the picture on their TV.

If you are using a pair of Roku wireless speakers, a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, or a Roku subwoofer, the device it is paired with will check at the same time to see whether new software is available for your wireless audio device. The download and installation are typically done automatically without interrupting use of your Roku device.\nYou can also manually check for a software update on your Roku device.\nFor help with a Roku camera, video doorbell, bulb, plug, or light strip, learn what to do if your Roku Smart Home device is unable to update software.\nWhat happens when there is an error during a software update\nTo perform a software update, your Roku TV or Roku player must have a good connection to the internet. If for some reason this connection is unreliable, or an unexpected outage exists, your Roku device may be unable to update to the latest software. Should this happen, you may see an on-screen error message similar to the one below.\n\nOr in some cases, you may see an on-screen message similar to the following.\n\nIn the message, you will typically see one of the following error codes: 001, 002, 003, 004, or 005 and others.\nHow to get the software to update successfully\nIt is possible that the Roku service may be temporarily unresponsive. If an error code is encountered during an attempt to update the software, wait a few minutes and try again. If Roku is aware of an extended outage, an alert will be displayed near the top of the Roku support site. If you see an alert here, try again when the outage is over.\nIf there is no alert and you continue to see the error message after multiple attempts, the update failure is likely the result of a network connectivity issue. Try the steps below to help resolve the problem.\n\nDid you connect your Roku player or Roku TV to the correct network? Selecting the wrong wireless network name (also called SSID) will cause your wireless network connection to fail. If you are not sure that your Roku device is connected to the correct network, get help finding your wireless network name and password.\nCheck to see that your router* is working properly. Use your computer or a mobile device to connect to the router and access the internet (try launching a website like www.roku.com). If you are able to connect to the internet on other devices, go to the next step.\nDo you have a strong enough wireless signal? If your password is correct and other devices can access the router, but the software update continues to fail, the most likely problem is the strength of the wireless signal. The wireless signal gets weaker the farther your Roku player or Roku TV is from your router, and with more obstacles (like walls and cabinets) between your router and your Roku device. Review these tips to help improve your wireless signal.\nIf you see an error message that indicates your Roku wireless audio device is disconnected when the device it is paired with tries to update the software, check that your wireless audio device is plugged in and the status LED on the device is on. You may need to it closer to the device it is paired with if the problem continues. For more connection help, review the appropriate troubleshooting article below.\nResolve pairing issues with Roku wireless speakers\nResolve pairing issues with a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar\n\nResolve pairing issues with a Roku subwoofer\n\n\nTry restarting the Roku device and your router. It will take a few minutes before both devices have restarted.\nTo restart your Roku player or Roku TV, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it. Or you can use the following steps to restart it from the Settings menu.\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\n\n\n\nFor a wireless audio device, unplug the power cable for a moment and plug it back in.\nTo restart your router, check the instructions from your internet Service Provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. In some cases, you can simply unplug it and plug it back in, and in other cases it may require pressing a reset button on the device.\n\n\nIf you have previously connected to your router, the Roku device should automatically reconnect. If it is not reconnecting, or if you are setting up your Roku device for the first time, complete the network setup process.\n\nWi-Fi vs. Ethernet\nA Roku player or Roku TV has the ability to connect to your router via Wi-Fi\u00ae, or wireless. Some Roku devices also have an Ethernet port or support for a third-party Ethernet adapter, both of which allow you to use a cable to connect to your network.\n\nIf it is convenient to connect the cable from your router to your compatible Roku device, Ethernet will give you a faster and more reliable connection. Simply connect a standard Ethernet cable from an available port on your router to your compatible Roku device.\nWireless can also give you excellent results, provided you are located close enough to your router to receive a clear signal.\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link.

HDMI also includes a couple lesser-known features called HDMI-CEC and ARC that use two-way communication over the same connection to simplify how you use and set up your entertainment system. However, before you can take advantage of these benefits it is important you check the settings on your TV and make sure the features are enabled. It is not uncommon for them to be disabled by default.\nThis article provides more details about HDMI-CEC and ARC, and outlines steps to enable the features for several common TV brands.\nWhat is HDMI-CEC?\nCEC, or Consumer Electronics Control, allows commands to be shared between devices over the same HDMI connection as audio and video, letting you control common functions of different devices without having to juggle remotes. For example, with CEC enabled you can use your TV remote to adjust the volume of a connected audio device such as a Roku Streambar\u00ae, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar. Or, with your Roku remote you can easily turn your TV on and off without needing to pick up another remote.\n\n\nNote: CEC does not allow control of all aspects of every device. For some functions, you may still need to use the original remote for a device.\n\nWhat is ARC?\nARC, or Audio Return Channel, lets your TV send audio to an external audio device such as a Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar without the need for additional cables. This allows audio from your TV's tuner and devices connected to your TV such as a Blu-ray player, game console, cable/satellite set-top box to be enjoyed on an audio device other than your TV's built-in speakers. To use this feature, the audio device must be connected to the \"HDMI ARC\" or \"ARC\" port, which is common on smart TVs manufactured in 2009 or later.\n\n\nNote: Consult the user manual or online documentation for your TV if you are not sure your TV has an ARC port.\n\nHow to enable CEC and ARC\nEnabling CEC and ARC is different for every TV brand. Some have separate settings for each, while others combine the features into one setting that turns ARC and CEC on or off at the same time. When looking through your TV's menus for these features, understand that manufacturers may not refer to them by name, but rather as part of a branded trade name. In general, you can often look in a \"settings\" menu for CEC-related settings, sometimes in a \"system\" or \"advanced\" submenu. ARC-related settings may be located in the same place, or they may appear separately in an \"audio\" or \"sound\" menu.\nEach brand in the list below includes the trade name(s) in parenthesis that the manufacturer typically uses when referring to the features in their TV menus. You can refer to the sample instructions that accompany some of the TV brands, but the steps may vary from model to model, and may change when TV software is updated. When in doubt, refer to the user manual or online documentation for your specific make and model.\n\nHitachi (HDMI-CEC)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress MENU on your Hitachi remote\nUse the right and left directional buttons to find the Setup submenu\nUse the up and down directional buttons to highlight HDMI-CEC\n\nPress SELECT\n\nSelect On to enable CEC\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Hitachi CEC steps 1 and 2\nUse the up and down directional buttons to highlight ARC\n\nPress SELECT\n\nSelect On to enable ARC\n\n\n\n\nLG (SIMPLINK)\n\n\nNote: SIMPLINK must be enabled using the CEC steps before you can enable ARC\n\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nHold Settings on your LG remote for 5 seconds to open the Settings menu\nSelect All Settings from the bottom right corner of your display\nSelect General from the left menu\nSelect SIMPLINK (HDMI-CEC)\n\nSet SIMPLINK (HDMI-CEC) to On, and confirm\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform LG CEC steps 1 and 2\nSelect Sound from the left menu\nSelect Sound Out\n\nSelect Audio Out (Optical/HDMI ARC)\n\nSet Digital Sound Out to Auto\n\n\n\n\n\nPanasonic (HDAVI Control, EZ Sync, or VIERA Link for CEC)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress MENU on your Panasonic remote\nUse the directional buttons to highlight Setup\n\nPress OK\n\nSelect HDMI control\n\nSelect CEC function\n\nSelect ON\n\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Panasonic CEC steps 1 through 3.\nSelect VIERA Link settings\n\nPress OK\n\nHighlight On\n\nPress OK\n\n\n\n\n\nPhillips (EasyLink)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress Home on your Phillips remote\nUse the directional buttons to highlight Setup\n\nPress OK\n\nSelect TV settings\n\nSelect Installation, followed by Preferences\n\nSelect EasyLink\n\nSet Master EasyLink to On\n\nSet Auto TV on to On\n\nSet RC key forwarding to On\n\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Phillips CEC steps 1 through 6\nSet HDMI-ARC to On\n\n\n\n\n\nRoku TVTM (CEC) - includes multiple brands\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Control other devices (CEC)\n\nScroll and highlight System audio control\n\nCheck the box to enable System audio control\nHighlight 1-touch play\n\nCheck the box to enable 1-touch play\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Roku TV CEC steps 1 through 4\nScroll and highlight ARC\n\nCheck the box to enable ARC\n\n\n\n\nSamsung (Anynet+)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress Home on your Samsung remote\nUse the directional pad on your remote to navigate and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Expert Settings\n\nSelect Anynet+ (HDMI-CEC)\n\nSelect On\n\n\nAlternate CEC steps:\n\nPerform Samsung CEC steps 1 and 2\nSelect General\n\nSelect External Device Manager\n\nEnable Anynet+ (HDMI-CEC)\n\n\nARC steps:\nARC is enabled automatically on Samsung TVs when Anynet+ (HDMI-CEC) is enabled.\n\n\n\nSharp (AQUOS Link)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress MENU on your Sharp remote\nSelect System Options\n\nSelect AQUOS Link Setup\n\nSet AQUOS Link Control to On\n\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Sharp CEC steps 1 through 3\nSet Audio Return Channel to Auto\n\n\n\n\n\nSony (BRAVIA Sync)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress Home on your Sony remote\nUse the directional buttons to highlight Settings\n\nPress OK\n\nSelect Watching TV\n\nSelect External inputs\n\nSelect BRAVIA Sync settings\n\nEnable BRAVIA Sync control\n\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Sony CEC steps 1 through 3\nSelect Display & Sound\n\nSelect Audio output\n\nSet eARC mode to Auto\n\n\n\n\n\nToshiba (CE-Link or Regza Link)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress MENU on your Toshiba remote\nUse the directional buttons to highlight Options\n\nPress OK\n\nSelect HDMI CEC Control Setup\n\nSet HDMI CEC Control to On\n\nSet TV Auto Power to On\n\nSet Auto Standby to On\n\nSet Amplifier Control to On\n\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Toshiba CEC steps 1 through 4\nSet Initial Speaker Setting to Receiver\n\n\n\n\n\nVizio (CEC)\n\n\nCEC steps:\n\nPress MENU on your Vizio remote\nSelect System\n\nSelect CEC\n\nUse the arrow buttons on your remote and set CEC Function to Enable\n\n\nARC steps:\n\nPerform Vizio CEC steps 1 through 4\nSet System Audio Control to On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more backgroundHDMI\u00ae is well known for its ability to deliver audio and video over a single connection from devices like Blu-rayTM players, game consoles, and Roku\u00ae streaming players.

Your Roku\u00ae streaming player can be configured to always detect the best resolution and frame rate of your TV, or you can choose to manually select the resolution and frame rate, known together as display type. Roku players that support High Dynamic Range (HDR) ship with an HDMI 2.0 compatible cable. If you cannot use the included cable, be sure to purchase a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable.\nWhat is resolution and frame rate?\nResolution is the measure of how much detail you can see on the screen. Typical resolutions on TVs today are 720p, 1080p and 4K Ultra HD (4K), with some 4K TVs also supporting higher frame rates and more color information with High Dynamic Range (HDR). The higher the resolution, the sharper and more realistic the image appears.\nWhen playing video, what you see is a quick succession of still images, or frames, which creates the illusion of motion or animation. The number of frames displayed each second is known as the frame rate and is measured in frames per second (fps), or frequency (Hz). The higher the frame rate, the smoother the motion appears.\nHow to configure your player to detect the best resolution and frame rateDuring setup, your Roku streaming player will analyze the HDMI\u00ae connection to determine the resolutions and frame rates supported by your TV. If your streaming player can determine the best configuration for your TV, the guided setup process will automatically select the best settings, so you do not have to manually configure the settings. The automatic setting is appropriate for most situations.How to change the display type\nIf your Roku streaming player is unable to correctly detect the capabilities of your TV, you may wish to configure the display type on your own. Follow the steps below to manually change your display type setting.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Display type\n\nSelect one of the available display types and press OK  on your remote\nYour screen may go black for a few seconds while the display setting is changed\nWhen an image is shown, select Yes, I can see it and press OK on your remote\nYour screen will return to the Display type menu\nA check  will appear next to the new display setting\n\n\n\nNote: If you receive a message indicating your TV does not support a display type, you can still select the display type and try it anyway.\n\n\nWhat to do if there is no picture after changing the display type\nIf you do not see a picture after choosing the new setting, your TV does not support the resolution or frame rate. Your streaming player will revert to the previous setting after 20 seconds. If you believe your TV supports the desired display type, but you continue to see no picture, review the setup requirements for 4K or the setup requirements for HDR..\n\nA note on HDMI cables\nRoku players that support HDR ship with an HDMI 2.0 compatible cable. If you cannot use the included cable, be sure to purchase a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable. The typically more expensive Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is a good choice for reducing potential Wi-Fi\u00ae and Bluetooth\u00ae interference, or for future-proofing an installation where the cable location is in an otherwise inaccessible area. Cables that are not labeled or may be labeled \"high speed\" or \"standard speed\" may not be adequate for 4K HDR10, HDR10+, or Dolby Vision content at 60fps.\nIf your Roku player is connected to an AVR or soundbar, make sure all cables are HDMI 2.0 compatible. If you see a black screen or poor performance and video degradation with a 4K HDR signal, replace any older cables with a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable.\n\nWhy is the image not in HDR or the picture quality poor when watching HDR content?When you specifically watch an HDR movie or TV show on your HDR-capable Roku device, you may notice the image is not displayed in HDR, or the picture quality is poor. If you encounter this behavior, you may need to update the software on your HDR-capable TV. You can typically find instructions how to do this along with the latest software on the TV manufacturer\u2019s website. Once you confirm that your TV is running the latest software, check that it is properly configured to enable HDR on the specific input to which your Roku player is connected. Some TVs that support HDR do not enable this feature by default.Read more backgroundTelevision manufacturers offer a variety of displays with different resolutions and frame rates.

In order for this to work, you need a good network connection from your router* to the Roku device.\nThis article is designed to help resolve the following issues:\n\nYou are unable to access your home wireless network and have tried the steps outlined for what to do if you cannot connect.\nYou are experiencing problems during playback and have tried the suggestions for identifying and resolving channel playback issues.\nYour Roku player detects a weak signal and displays an on-screen error message such as one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all cases, your wireless signal is likely inadequate. The suggestions below will help to further identify the issue and improve the quality of the wireless signal.\nCheck your Wi-Fi signal strength\nYour Roku device detects the strength of the wireless signal it is receiving, but you can only view this information when your Roku device is connected to the network.\nIf your Roku device is not connected, you must first set up the wireless network connection. When doing so:\n\nIf you do not see your network name, your Roku device may be too far from the router. Try the steps listed below to improve the wireless signal and then try setting up the wireless connection again.\nYou may want to consider connecting temporarily to a different wireless network to help troubleshoot.\n\nOnce your Roku device is connected, you can find the strength of the wireless signal using the instructions below.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Network\n\nSelect About\n\n\nThe wireless signal strength will be reported as Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent.\n\nIf you make changes that may impact the strength of the signal, such as the location of the router or your Roku device, you can check the wireless signal strength at any time by selecting Check connection.\nWhen a connection check finishes, you can see a snapshot with the latest results including the signal strength and internet download speed. To help understand the results, review the detailed article about the network connection check.\nImprove your wireless connection\nSignal strength can vary due to factors such as the amount of wireless traffic and the usage of other devices on your network. If the results from a connection check display poor or fair signal strength, or you experience connection or playback issues regardless of the results, try the suggestions below to help improve your wireless connection.\n\n\nEliminate wireless interference: Cordless phones, microwave ovens, or other wireless devices near your router can cause wireless interference that may effect the quality of your network connection. Move any such device away from your wireless router.\n\n\nCheck with your ISP: Visit the website of your internet service provider, or ISP (usually your cable or phone company), or contact them directly to inquire about any outages or connectivity-related issues. You should also confirm that your internet package provides speeds fast enough for streaming.\n\n\nReduce network usage by other devices: Devices currently accessing the network, such as other streaming players, computers, game consoles, and mobile devices may effect the quality of your network connection. Temporarily stop using any such device and check if that makes a difference. You may need to reduce usage of other network devices when using your Roku device.\n\n\nMove your Roku device or Router:\n\n\nReduce distance: Moving your Roku device and router closer to each other will strengthen the wireless signal. If this is not an ideal long-term solution, at least try moving the devices closer temporarily to verify the signal strength is the problem. Sometimes moving each device even a short distance may make a difference.\n\nEliminate obstructions: Install both devices where there are fewer objects and walls between them. If your router or Roku device is inside a cabinet, we recommend taking it out. Reducing the number of obstructions will improve the signal strength.\n\nAdjust router antennas: If your router has one or more external antennas, try re-orienting the antennas and check the signal strength.\n\nTry an elevated location: Try moving your router and/or Roku device to a higher location in the room.\n\nMove away from the TV: If your TV is located between the Roku device and the router, try moving the Roku device to a location where the TV is not blocking the wireless signal. If you are using a Roku\u00ae Streaming Stick\u00ae, try moving it away from your TV by installing the free HDMI extender cable.\n\n\nNote: The Roku Streaming Stick+ connects to the network via advanced wireless receiver. Using an HDMI extender will not improve the wireless signal strength.\n\n\n\nTry another TV: If you have a Roku player, move it to a different TV that is closer to your wireless router to confirm the wireless signal strength is the problem.\n\n\n\nAdditional options\nIf the wireless signal is still not strong enough after trying the suggestions above, here are some additional options:\n\n\nPurchase a new router: A new wireless router may provide a stronger signal, or may have more reliable software. Routers do vary considerably in their quality \u2013 so read the online reviews.\n\nAdvanced home network options: There are more advanced home network options, such as range extenders, \u201cmesh network\u201d routers, or powerline extenders which can increase wireless coverage within your house. You can also try out the \"Pro tips\" listed at the end of the article.\n\nUse Ethernet: If you have a Roku device with an Ethernet jack, you may be able to connect an Ethernet cable. Or Ethernet may be a temporary solution to verify that the wireless connection is your real problem.\n\nTry another TV: If you have a Roku player, move it to a different TV that is closer to your wireless router to confirm the wireless signal strength is the problem.\n\nIf these steps haven't resolved your issue, you can return your Roku device for a refund (if within the return window of your retailer).\nPro tips\nIf you are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network: If your router and Roku device both support 5GHz, make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network.\n\n\nNote: Not all Roku devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the wireless channel: When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\n\n\n\nIf your Roku device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network: Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your Roku device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common. Additionally, if your 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless networks have different network names, your Roku device will only be able to connect to the 2.4GHz wireless network.To optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your Roku device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\nMove the router farther away: If your router is close to your Roku device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your Roku device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.Read more backgroundYour Roku streaming player or Roku TVTM provides you with access to stream video and music from the internet.

This article describes the product in more detail and outlines the setup steps.\nWill the Roku Streaming Stick 4K work with my TV?\nYour Roku Streaming Stick 4K will work with any television with an HDMI\u00ae connection and connects directly to the TV's HDMI port. However, you will not be able to take advantage of 4K resolution, or Dolby VisionTM, HDR10+, and similar HDR formats without a compatible TV. You can see more requirements in the detailed articles about setting up your Roku player for 4K or setting up your Roku player for HDR.\nIf your Roku Streaming Stick 4K will not fit in your TV's HDMI port due to space restrictions, then you may wish to get a free HDMI extender cable.\nWhat is the long-range Wi-Fi\u00ae receiver?The long-range Wi-Fi receiver is part of the USB power cable that must be attached to your Roku Streaming Stick 4K. It allows your Streaming Stick to connect to your wireless network and the internet so you can stream movies, TV shows and more. The Wi-Fi receiver is designed to reduce wireless interference providing a faster and more reliable connection. Power is provided to your Streaming Stick by connecting the USB power cable to the USB port on your TV, or preferably, a wall outlet (when used with the power adaptor).How to connect your Streaming Stick\nUse the diagrams below as a guide to help connect your Roku Streaming Stick 4K. Make sure all connections are secure and firmly attached.\n\nTo get started, connect your Roku Streaming Stick 4K to an available HDMI port on your TV. If you plan to stream movies and TV shows in 4K or HDR, remember to select an HDMI 2.0 port that supports HDCP 2.2. Learn what to look for when trying to identify an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2.\nIf your Streaming Stick will not easily connect to the HDMI port on your TV due to space restrictions, then you may wish to get a free HDMI extender cable.\nNext, plug the USB power cable into a suitable power source \u2013 either the USB port on your TV, or preferably, a wall outlet (when used with the power adaptor).\n\n\nNote: The USB port on some TV\u2019s may be unable to power a Streaming Stick. If you see the on-screen warning message that appears in these cases, use a wall outlet.\n\nFinally, attach the Wi-Fi receiver firmly to the Roku Streaming Stick 4K. A poor connection will prevent your Streaming Stick from connecting to your wireless network and ultimately the internet. If you recently moved your Streaming Stick from another HDMI input, or another TV altogether, make sure to check that all connections are secure before use.\nSetting up your Streaming Stick\n\nReview the Quick Start Guide below, or follow along with the tutorial video:\n Roku Streaming Stick 4K (model 3820)\n\n\nUse your TV remote to power on your television and select the input where you connected your Streaming Stick.

Help is available if you do not see any picture on your TV.\nFollow the on-screen instructions to set up your Roku voice remote. For more assistance setting, learn how to set up your Roku voice remote.\n\nOn-screen setup and activation\nA welcome screen will appear after you switch your TV input to where your streaming device is connected. During setup, you will choose a language, connect to the internet, download the latest updates, configure display settings, and finally activate your Roku streaming device. You must create or use an existing Roku account and then activate and link your device using an activation link sent to your email or accessed with a QR code. Learn how to enable the text-to-speech screen reader, if you need audial assistance navigating through setup.\nChoose a language\nThe first screen you see will allow you to choose a language. Scroll through the list and press OK  on your Roku remote to choose a language. All text and dialog within the Roku interface will be displayed in the selected language.\n\n\nNote: It is the responsibility of the channel publisher to translate their channel and some channels may not support your chosen language.\n\nConnect to the internet\nChoose your wireless network from the list of available networks and enter your password. This is often the same network you use to connect your computer or smartphone to the internet. If you do not see your network, select Scan again to see all networks. For more assistance, see help finding your wireless network and password.\nIf you want to see your password as you type, choose Show password. This can help prevent entering the wrong password. Remember, passwords are case-sensitive. Use the shift button  on the on-screen keyboard to enter a capital letter.\nOnce you enter your password and select Connect, your device will automatically connect to the internet. Alternatively, you can get more help if you are unable to connect to your wireless network.\nDownload the latest updates\nOnce connected to the internet, your streaming device will check to see if there is a software update available, download the latest version if necessary, and automatically reboot after updating.\nConfigure display settings\nSelect Set display type and let your streaming device auto detect the best display resolution so you do not have to manually configure the settings. To change the display type at a later time, go to Settings > Display type.\nIf support for 4K or HDR is not detected on your compatible Roku device, and you are using a compatible TV, make sure all HDMI cables are firmly attached and all connections support HDCP 2.2. For more help, review the steps for 4K setup or HDR setup.\n\n\nNote: This step may be done automatically by your device. If this step is not shown during setup, your device was able to do this step automatically for you.\n\nSet up your Roku voice remote to control your TV\nSelect Check remote settings to automatically set up your Roku voice remote to control the power and volume for your TV. If you skip this step, you can set up your remote for TV control at any time from the Settings menu. Simply go to Settings > Remotes & devices > Remotes > [select your remote] > Set up remote for TV control. A Roku voice remote may not be able to control volume and power on all TV models. With some TV models, you may only be able to control the volume, and not the power.\n\n\nNote: This setup step only appears if you are using a Roku voice remote with TV controls. Certain Roku devices released in 2017 and later include this remote, or you can purchase one from the Roku accessories store.\n\nCreate a Roku account and activate your device\nWhen prompted on screen, you will need to perform the following steps to create your Roku account and complete device activation. It may take a few moments to receive the activation email from Roku. If you do not see it in your email inbox, be sure to check your spam (or junk) folder.\n\n\nPress OK  on your remote to reveal the on-screen keyboard.\n\n\nUsing your remote, type a valid email address. If you have a voice remote, you can press and hold the voice  button and say your email address instead.\n\n\nImportant: This email will also be used as your Roku login, which is important for managing your Roku account and device services.\n\n\nIf you have trouble receiving the activation link in your email, press Star  on your remote and try again or select Activate with a QR Code option. Use your mobile phone's camera to scan the QR code and get the device activation link.\nOnce you open the link, either from the email or QR code, follow the instructions for creating a Roku account and setting up your Roku device with channels to watch.\n\nIf you cannot get your Roku device activated, learn how to resolve linking issues. Roku does not require an activation fee, or charge for support of any kind. Learn how to avoid fraudulent websites.\nEnjoy your Roku device!\nWith all steps complete, your Roku streaming device is ready to use. You can personalize your device by changing your theme pack or screensaver and you can use the Roku Channel Store to add new streaming channels, games, and other apps.\nWhy is the image not in HDR or the picture quality poor when watching HDR content?\nWhen you specifically watch an HDR movie or TV show on your HDR-capable Roku device, you may notice the image is not displayed in HDR, or the picture quality is poor. If you encounter this behavior, you may need to update the software on your HDR-capable TV. You can typically find instructions how to do this along with the latest software on the TV manufacturer\u2019s website. Once you confirm that your TV is running the latest software, check that it is properly configured to enable HDR on the specific input to which your Roku player is connected. Some TVs that support HDR do not enable this feature by default.Read more background\nThe Roku\u00ae Streaming Stick\u00ae 4K (model 3820) supports 720p HD, 1080p Full HD, 4K Ultra HD (4K) and HDR (High Dynamic Range) and ships with a Roku voice remote with TV controls.

With no wires, the battery powered remote can be placed anywhere you can hear your Roku device. This article describes the product in more detail and outlines the setup steps.\nWhere to use your tabletop remote\nRoku Touch is a simple remote designed to help you quickly control your Roku device when you are somewhere nearby, but not specifically sitting in your primary viewing location. Without all the same buttons you find on your handheld Roku remote, it is not intended to replace that remote, but instead work with it to improve your overall streaming experience.\nWhere you decide to use your Roku Touch will depend on the layout of your home and the room where the Roku device you plan to control is located. If you have an open floor plan, you may want to rest your Roku Touch on an entryway table so you can start playback of some relaxing music after a long day at the office. You may decide to set it on a desk and launch popular podcasts from afar when you are paying the monthly bills. If your kitchen is nearby, rest your Roku Touch on the counter for those times you need to pause the kids' show or turn down the volume when it is time for dinner. Or, set it next to the coffee maker and start listening to a radio news program while brewing a fresh pot each morning.\n\n\nNote: Your Roku Touch tabletop remote must be used within listening distance of your Roku device. The usable distance can be degraded by some building materials and the stability of your wireless network.\n\nPair your Roku Touch\nTo pair your Roku Touch, you must put it in pairing mode along with your Roku device. To begin, use the following steps to put your Roku player or Roku TV in pairing mode.\n\nPress Home  on your handheld Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Pair new device\n\nSelect Remote\n\n\nWhen your Roku device is in pairing mode, an on-screen progress indicator tells you when it is searching for, and pairing with the remote. Use the steps below to put your Roku Touch into pairing mode and complete the pairing process.\n\nRemove the battery cover from the bottom of your tabletop remote and insert two new AAA batteries\nPress and hold the pairing button located in the battery compartment for 5 seconds, or until you see the light inside the compartment begin to flash. This pairing indicator will be accompanied by your tabletop remote telling you it is \"searching for devices\".\nAfter the remote pairs automatically, your Roku device will return to the Remotes & devices menu.\n\nNow that your Roku Touch is paired with your Roku device, you should learn about the buttons that let you search and control your Roku device.\n\n\n\nNote: The diamond button  on Roku Touch is reserved for future use.\n\nUse voice commands\nUsing voice commands with your Roku Touch gives you quick access to your favorite music, live radio stations, popular podcasts, and more from Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn. If you have a Roku TV, you can even use voice commands to search and control your music when the TV screen is off.\nFor the best experience, Pandora and TuneIn require you create an account and log in to start listening to free or premium content. If you want to begin listening right away, iHeartRadio gives you access to free content without an account, but you will need to create one if you plan to subscribe to their premium services.\nWhen you are ready, you can press and hold the Voice button  and speak naturally saying a command like, \"listen to classical music on Pandora\", \"play Stuff You Should Know on iHeartRadio\", or \"play Today's Hits on TuneIn\". Your Roku device will launch the specified channel and begin playing the music, radio station, or podcast audio. For more details about voice control of your music, and where you can find audio content, read the detailed articles below:\n\nHow to listen to music with voice commands\nHow to listen to music when the screen on your Roku TV is off\nOverview of different voice commands\n\nCustomize your personal shortcuts\nYou can program a personal shortcut button to perform an often-used voice command with a single press. To begin, press and hold the Voice button  and say a voice command like \"play classic rock\". Next, wait for the command to be executed, and then press and hold the personal shortcut button until you hear the success tone come from your Roku Touch.\nThe personal shortcut button is now programmed to the last voice command you issued. Any time you press it, that voice command will be issued with a single touch.\n\n\nNote: You can reassign personal shortcut buttons as often as you like.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, read about how you can program a personal shortcut button on your Roku Touch tabletop remote.\nWhy are the volume buttons not working?\nThe volume buttons on your Roku Touch tabletop remote will control the volume on all Roku TV models, but when paired with a Roku player, the volume buttons may not work. This is because your Roku Touch cannot directly control devices that are connected to your Roku player, such as your TV (and its built-in speakers), an audio/video receiver (AVR), or soundbar.\nHowever, your Roku player may be able to send volume commands to your TV, AVR, or soundbar using a technology called HDMI-CEC. In these cases, your Roku Touch remote can indirectly control volume for your TV, AVR, or soundbar. For this to work, all your devices must be connected via HDMI, and all devices must support HDMI-CEC and have this feature enabled. To learn if your TV, AVR or soundbar supports this technology, refer to the device's documentation.\n\n\nNote: Manufacturers may refer to HDMI-CEC by a different name, such as Sony BRAVIA Sync, LG SimpLink, and Samsung Anynet+. Other manufacturers like Hitachi and Vizio use the standard term HDMI-CEC or CEC.\nRead more background\nYour Roku Touch is a tabletop remote that lets you use voice commands or simple button presses to quickly begin listening to music, search for content, or control playback on your Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TVTM.

When casting, you can only watch content available from a mobile app that specifically supports casting.

With casting you only see playback of the selected piece of content, whereas with screen mirroring, you see the entire screen of your mobile device including buttons and menus \u2013 every action is mirrored on your TV.\n\nHow you control playback. Casting gives you the option to use your mobile device for control or you can choose to use your Roku remote. During a screen mirroring session, all actions are controlled on your mobile device.\n\nPower state of your phone or tablet. Once playback begins, casting lets you use your mobile device to do something else or you can power it off entirely. Screen mirroring requires that your mobile device remain powered on for the duration of playback.\n\nSupported mobile devices. Casting is supported on most mobile devices \u2013 if you see a casting icon in an app, you may be able to send content to your TV (but not in all cases). Screen mirroring is limited to compatible AndroidTM and Windows\u00ae devices.\n\nTo learn more about replicating the screen from your compatible mobile device on your TV, review the detailed article about screen mirroring.\nHow to cast from a supported channel\nTo begin casting, you need to install the channel and matching mobile app and start playback. Refer to the instructions below for help.\n\nIf not already installed, add the channel to your Roku device.\nInstall the matching mobile app on your phone or tablet.\nLaunch the app on your mobile device.\n\n\nNote: You do not need to open the matching channel on your Roku device to begin casting.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the casting icon  from inside the mobile app.\n\n\nNote: With some apps, the casting icon may not appear until you begin playback on your mobile device.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the list of available devices on your phone or tablet, select your Roku device.\nThe channel will launch automatically on your Roku device and playback of the content will begin.\n\n\nNote: When casting to channels that support profiles (e.g., Netflix) you may need to select your profile with your Roku remote before playback will begin.\n\n\n\nDuring playback, you can use your mobile device to find and begin casting another program, do something entirely different, or turn it off completely \u2013 all without affecting playback on your Roku device.\nCan I share my personal photos and videos using the Roku mobile app?\nAnother way to share your personal photos and videos, or songs from the music library stored on your mobile device is with the Play on Roku feature on the Roku mobile app. The Roku mobile app is a free application for iOS\u00ae and AndroidTM devices.\nTo learn more about sharing personal media files from your compatible mobile device, read the detailed article about Play on Roku.Read more backgroundYou can of course launch channels directly from your Roku streaming player or Roku TVTM, but on some occasions, you may want to direct, or cast, to your TV what you are already watching on your mobile device.

Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data over short distances (typically less than 30 feet). When Bluetooth headphones are connected, you can listen to any content streaming on your Roku device. If you have a Roku Streambar\u00ae or Streambar Pro you can also listen to audio from your TV, if connected via an HDMI ARC or optical connection. If your streaming device does not support Bluetooth private listening, you may be able to use wired headphones with a Roku voice remote for private listening instead.\nThis article provides instructions for pairing and connecting your Bluetooth earbuds or headphones to your compatible Roku streaming device.\nWhich devices are compatible with Bluetooth private listening?\nBluetooth private listening is only available on Roku streaming devices with Bluetooth capability. Any Bluetooth headphones that support Bluetooth version 4.2 or greater can connect to a compatible Roku streaming device. Visit the Roku product comparison chart to see which current Roku streaming devices have Bluetooth.\nCompatible Roku streaming devices\nThe following Roku streaming devices have Bluetooth capability:\n\n\nRoku Streambar\u00ae\n\nRoku Streambar Pro\nRoku Smart Soundbar\n\nRoku Ultra (models 4800 and 4802)\n\nRoku Ultra LT (model 4801)\n\n\nTo find the model of your Roku streaming device, you can go to the Home screen and select Settings > System > About.\n\n\nNote: The only TV that Bluetooth headphones can pair with for private listening is a Roku Plus Series TV. If a Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar is connected to your TV, you can still pair your headphones with the streambar or soundbar directly.\n\nHow to pair Bluetooth headphones\nBefore you can begin streaming Bluetooth audio, you need to pair your headphones to your compatible Roku streaming device. This is done through a discovery process which allows Bluetooth devices to register information about each other and then make a secure wireless connection. Because this pairing information is retained even when Bluetooth devices are powered off, it is typically only necessary to pair your Bluetooth device one time. After you complete the pairing process, your headphones will appear in the list of paired devices and a headphone icon  will appear on the television screen when adjusting volume.\nUse the steps below to pair your headphones:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Wireless headphones\n\nSelect Add new wireless headphones\n\nTurn on your Bluetooth headphones and put them in pairing mode\nWait while your Roku device scans for Bluetooth headphones. This can take up to 30 seconds.\nSelect your Bluetooth headphones from the list of available devices\n\n\n\nNote: The Wireless headphones menu option will only appear on a compatible Roku device.\n\nIf you need help pairing your Bluetooth headphones, refer to the manufacturer's support site for instructions. Links for some common brands are listed below:\n\nApple AirPodTM\nGoogle Pixel Buds\nSamsung Galaxy Buds\nBeats Studio Buds\nSony headphones or earbuds\nBose headphones or in-ear headsets\nJBL headphones\n\nHow to connect Bluetooth headphones\nOnce your Bluetooth headphones are paired, you can easily connect them in the Settings menu or while playing content without having to re-pair them. You can also choose to have your headphones connect automatically when they are powered on and within range of your Roku device.\n\n\nTip: To reduce battery consumption on your headphones, your Roku device will disconnect from your headphones if the screensaver starts or no audio has been streaming for several minutes.\n\nConnect headphones\nUse the following steps to connect your headphones in the Settings menu:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Wireless headphones\n\nSelect your headphones\nSelect Connect\n\n\nIf you are already playing content and need to connect headphones, use these instructions instead:\n\nPress Star  on the Roku remote\nScroll and select Wireless headphones\n\nSelect your headphones\nSelect Connect\n\n\nChange auto-detect settings\nIn most situations, when your Bluetooth headphones are powered on they will automatically try to connect to the most recent device. If auto-detect is turned off or your headphones do not automatically connect, you will need to use the previous instructions to manually connect your headphones when you want to use private listening. You can change auto-detect in the Settings menu on your Roku streaming device.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Wireless headphones\n\nSelect your headphones\nToggle Auto-detect\n\n\nHow to disconnect Bluetooth headphones\nYou can disconnect your Bluetooth headphones in the Settings menu, while playing content, or you can simply power them off.\nUse the following steps to disconnect your headphones in the Settings menu:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Wireless headphones\n\nSelect your headphones\nSelect Disconnect\n\n\nIf you are already playing content on your streaming device, use these instructions instead:\n\nPress Star  on the Roku remote\nScroll and select Wireless headphones\n\nSelect your headphones\nSelect Disconnect\n\n\nHow to change volume and use media controls\nYou can adjust the loudness of your headphones by either using the volume up and down controls on your headphones or the Volume up  and Volume down  buttons on your Roku remote. Compatible Roku devices will also support play/pause, next track, and previous track controls from your headphones.\n\n\nNote: Not all Bluetooth headphones support volume and media controls.

To accomplish this, you can connect it to your wireless network, or if your Roku device supports the feature, you can connect it to your wired network using a compatible third-party Ethernet adapter.\nThis article provides information about compatible Roku devices and Ethernet adapters, and explains how you can connect your compatible devices to your wired network.\nIs my Roku device compatible?\nNot all Roku devices support using an Ethernet adapter to connect to your wired network. To help determine if your device is compatible, you need to know the device model. To find this information, go to the home screen on your Roku device and select Settings > System > About. The models below support an external third-party Ethernet adapter.\n\n\n\nDevice\nModel\n\n\n\n\n\n Roku Express\n\n 3960\n\n\n\n Roku Express 4K \n\n 3940 \n\n\n Roku Express 4K+ \n 3941 \n\n\n Roku StreambarTM \n 9102 \n\n\n Roku Streambar Pro \n 9101R2 \n\n\n Roku Smart Soundbar \n 9101 \n\n\n onn.TM\u2022 Roku Smart Soundbar \n 9100 \n\n\n\nWhat Ethernet adapters are supported?\nWhen you are looking for an Ethernet adapter that is compatible with your Roku device, use the following guidelines to narrow your search.\n\n\nSpeed: Streaming high-resolution content (like 4K HDR movies with Dolby Atmos) typically requires no more than 25 Mbps. Look for an adapter that only supports 10/100 Mbps speeds. Adapters that also support 1000 Mbps will not work.\n\nChipset: Find an adapter that has an AX8877X or SMSC95XX chipset. This information is typically available with the manufacturer specifications.\n\nInterface: An adapter with a standard USB connector is needed for your Roku Streambar or soundbar. An adapter with a micro USB connector is needed for your Roku Express 4K or Express 4K+.\n\nThe third-party adapters below have been tested and verified with your compatible Roku device.\n\n\n\nDevice\nTested adapters\n\n\n\n\n Roku Express  Roku Express 4K  Roku Express 4K+ \n\n\nUGREEN micro USB to RJ45 Ethernet network adapter\nCable Matters micro USB to Ethernet adapter\nWeixinke micro USB to RJ45 Ethernet 100Mbps network adapter\nTV xStream USB to RJ45 Ethernet adapter\nBelker micro USB to RJ45 Ethernet adapter\n\n\n\n\n Roku Streambar  Roku Streambar Pro  Roku Smart Soundbar  onn. \u2022 Roku Smart Soundbar \n\n\nPlugable USB 2.0 to Ethernet fast 10/100 LAN wired network adapter\nTRENDnet USB 2.0 to 10/100 fast Ethernet LAN wired network adapter\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make the wired connection\nTo begin, firmly attach your compatible Ethernet adapter to the USB or micro USB port on the back of your Roku device. If you have a Roku Express 4K or Express 4K+, disconnect the USB power cable from the micro USB port before attaching your Ethernet adapter.\n\nNext, attach one end of a network cable to the Ethernet port on your compatible adapter, and the opposite end to your router*. If you have a Roku Express 4K or Roku Express 4K+, you also need to connect your Ethernet adapter to the power adapter included with your Roku player and plug that into a wall outlet to provide power to your Ethernet adapter.\nYou are now ready to configure your Roku device to look for the wired connection.\nHow to configure your Roku device\nAfter the physical connection is made, you can configure the network connection during the initial setup of your Roku device or you can do it at any time from the Settings menu.\n\n\nInitial setup\nIf you are setting up your Roku device for the first time, you need to use the standard on-screen setup process described in the appropriate article below.\n\nSetting up your Roku Express\nSetting up your Roku Express 4K\nSetting up your Roku Express 4K+\nSetting up your Roku Streambar\nSetting up your Roku Streambar Pro or Smart Soundbar\n\n\n\nNote: If you are connecting your Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar to a Roku TVTM, you may see the on-screen setup process begin automatically after plugging in power and attaching the HDMI\u00ae cable. This is not the standard on-screen process described in the articles above. It is the automatic setup process which offers a simple, hands-free approach to configuring your device and linking it to your Roku account, but only with a wireless network connection. To configure your Streambar or soundbar for a wired network connection, you can choose to complete this automatic setup process and configure the wired connection later from the Settings menu. Or, you can cancel the automatic setup process, wait for your Roku TV to return to the home screen, and then switch to the appropriate HDMI input (where you Streambar or soundbar is connected) and complete the standard on-screen setup process.\n\nSettings menu\nIf your Roku device is already set up with a wireless network connection, switch your TV to the HDMI input where your Roku device is connected and use the steps below to configure your device from the Settings menu.\n\n\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Network\n\nSelect Set up connection\n\nSelect Wired\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the input for my Streambar or soundbar? If you have a Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar connected to a Roku TV and it was set up using the automatic setup process, the HDMI input tile for your Streambar or soundbar was hidden. To access the built-in streaming player and connect it to your wired network, you need to first unhide the HDMI input tile using the following steps.\n\n\n\nFollow steps 1 and 2 above to open the Settings menu\nSelect TV inputs\n\nSelect Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar\n\nSelect Show input\n\nOnce the input for your Streambar or soundbar is visible, use the previous instructions to configure the wired connection.\n\n\n\nFor additional help, read the dedicated article about connecting a Roku device to your network and the internet.\n\nWhy is the Wired option not available?\nWhen a compatible Ethernet adapter is detected, your Roku device will automatically add the Wired option to the network connection type screen. If you do not see this option, make sure you are using a supported adapter based on the guidelines provided earlier in this article.\nIf your adapter is compatible and you do not see the Wired option, try unplugging your Roku device from the power outlet, and then remove and reattach the Ethernet adapter. When the adapter is firmly connected, power on your Roku device and try again.\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.Read more backgroundTo stream your favorite content from the internet, your Roku\u00ae device must maintain a good connection to your network and the internet.

Before you begin troubleshooting, first determine which type of handheld remote you use with your Roku streaming device: A Roku simple remote or a Roku voice remote. A Roku remote with a voice button that has a microphone icon, or a magnifying glass icon is a Roku voice remote. A remote that does not have a voice button is a Roku simple remote.\n\nIf you have a Roku TouchTM Tabletop Remote, see the tabletop remote troubleshooting guide instead.\nIf you need additional help figuring out which remote you have, review our guidelines for determining the type of Roku remote.\nHow the Roku simple and Roku voice remotes work\nHow does my Roku simple remote work?\nYour Roku simple remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to transmit button presses a short distance. For your simple remote to operate reliably, it must be pointed directly at your Roku streaming device and there must be nothing blocking the signal from travelling to the front of that device, where the IR receiver is located.\n\nTo set up a simple remote, you only need to insert new matching batteries and point the remote directly at the front of your streaming device when you are using it.\nHow does my Roku voice remote work?\nYour Roku voice remote communicates with your Roku streaming device over a dedicated wireless connection. Unlike a simple remote, you do not need to point your voice remote directly at your streaming device when pressing buttons. This allows you to install your streaming device behind a wall-mounted TV or another nearby, out-of-sight location.\nWhen setting up your voice remote, your streaming device uses a discovery process called pairing to detect a new remote and create the direct wireless connection. If your voice remote came in the box with your Roku device, you likely completed the pairing process during the initial setup and activation. If you upgraded to a voice remote after your Roku device was set up, you likely completed the pairing process from the Settings menu. Learn more about how to set up your Roku voice remote.\nTroubleshooting your Roku simple remote\nTo resolve issues with your Roku simple remote, start by looking for visible obstructions. The most common issue for a simple remote is missed button presses, which happen when your Roku streaming device is in a location where the remote signal is partially or fully blocked. Here are a few tips to ensure a clear path from your remote to your streaming device:\n\n\nAlways be sure you can see the front of your Roku device. When the device is powered on, you should see the status light on the front of the device.\n\nTest your remote from various positions. Try holding your remote higher (e.g., above your head) and point it downwards at the front of your Roku streaming device. Move the remote to the left and right, making sure it is always pointing directly at the front of your streaming device. If your streaming device becomes more responsive when testing from various positions, check that no obstructions are blocking the front of your device or the signal from your remote. If possible, move your streaming device to a position where it responds more reliably..\n\nDo not hide your streaming player. If your streaming player is attached to your TV with the included adhesive strip, move it to a position where the signal is less likely to be blocked. Do not install it inside a closed cabinet or behind your TV.\n\n\nTroubleshooting your Roku voice remote\nIf your Roku voice remote is unresponsive, there are several troubleshooting steps you can take to attempt to solve any issues. Prior to taking any troubleshooting steps, it is important to know what type of battery your remote has, since troubleshooting steps will vary slightly. There are two varieties: Those that have a built-in rechargeable battery and those that use standard batteries.\nIf you are experiencing a different issue where your voice remote is not controlling power or volume on your TV, additional help is available in this detailed article.\nTroubleshoot your rechargeable voice remote:\nRoku voice remotes with a rechargeable battery do not have a battery compartment. Both the status light and pairing button are located directly on the back of the remote.\n\nEnsure your Roku streaming device is up to date\nVerify your streaming device is running Roku OS 9.4 or higher. Go to Settings > System > About to check the software version. If necessary, manually check your device for an update.\nRe-pair your voice remote to your streaming device\nPut your streaming device in pairing mode:\n\nRemove the power cable from your streaming device\nWait at least 5 seconds\nRe-connect the power cable\nWait for your streaming device to power on, and the Home screen to appear on your TV screen\nWithin 30 seconds of seeing the Home screen on your TV screen, put your voice remote into pairing mode\n\nPut your voice remote in pairing mode:\n\nPress and hold the pairing button on your voice remote for 20 seconds. The status light should slowly flash green, stop, and then flash rapidly. When this happens, release the pairing button and your remote will restart.\nPress and hold the pairing button for 5 seconds, or until you see the status light begin to flash. If the light does not flash, charge your remote.\nWait for 30 seconds while the remote establishes a connection with your streaming device.\n\nOnce you streaming device and remote are connected, the pairing dialog will appear on your TV screen.\nRecharge your voice remote\nIf you have not already attempted to recharge your voice remote:\n\nConnect the small, micro-USB end of the charging cable to the charging port on your remote\nConnect the other end to a standard USB power adaptor\nThe status light will flash slowly when charging and change to a solid green when complete\n\nIf the status light does not begin to flash within a few seconds, try an alternate charging cable and power adaptor. Remember to use the Roku provided micro-USB cable that came with your voice remote for the best results. If you are still having issues, please restart your device and try again.\nTroubleshoot your voice remote with standard batteries:\nRoku voice remotes with standard batteries and a microphone pinhole beneath the power power button have the pairing button and status light beneath the battery cover on the back of the remote. On some older Roku voice remotes, the status light is located on the front of the remote.\nRoku voice remotes with standard batteries and a microphone pinhole to the left of the power power button do not have a pairing button. The status light is located to the left of the power button beneath the surface of the plastic and is not visible until lit.\n \nRe-pair your voice remote to your streaming device\nPut your streaming device in pairing mode:\n\nRemove the power cable from your streaming device\nWait at least 5 seconds\nRe-connect the power cable\nWait for your streaming device to power on, and the Home screen to appear on your TV screen\nWithin 30 seconds of seeing the Home screen on your TV screen, put your voice remote into pairing mode\n\nPut your voice remote in pairing mode:\n\nRemove the battery cover on the back of your voice remote\nRemove both batteries from the battery compartment\nWait 5 seconds and then reinsert the batteries\nIf your remote has a pairing button, press and hold the pairing button for 5 seconds, or until you see the status light begin to flash.\nIf your remote does not have a pairing button, press and hold both the Home  button and Back  button for 5 seconds, or until you see the status light begin to flash.\nIf the status light does not flash, try replacing the batteries.\nWait for 30 seconds while the remote establishes a connection with your streaming device.\n\nOnce you streaming device and remote are connected, the pairing dialog will appear on your TV screen.\nReplace your remote batteries\n\nRemove the battery cover on the back of your remote\nRemove both batteries from the battery compartment\nReplace the batteries with a new matching pair and test again\n\nAdditional troubleshooting steps for all Roku remotes\nIf your Roku remote is lagging, unresponsive, or otherwise unable to control your Roku streaming device, and you have not yet attempted these steps, try the list of troubleshooting tips below:\nInstall an HDMI\u00ae extension cable\nWhen using a Roku\u00ae Streaming Stick\u00ae that can be connected directly to an HDMI port on your TV, wireless interference from the HDMI connector may impact the performance of your remote. If you are troubleshooting a Roku Streaming Stick, move it away from the HDMI connector on your TV by installing a free extension cable.\nTroubleshoot your remote batteries\nIf your remote uses standard batteries, slide open the battery cover, remove the batteries for a moment and then reinsert them. With a Roku simple remote, you can immediately try to control your streaming device. With a Roku voice remote, wait at least 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes a connection with your streaming device. To test for a successful connection, press the voice button and look for a status indicator on your TV screen. If the issue is not resolved, replace the batteries with a new matching pair and try again.\nIf your remote is rechargeable, press and hold the pairing button for 20 seconds. The status light should slowly flash green, stop, then flash rapidly. When this happens, release the pairing button and your remote has restarted. Wait at least 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes a connection with your streaming device. To test for a successful connection, press the voice button and look for a status indicator on your TV screen.\nReplace your Roku remote\nIf none of the previous steps solved the issue, you may need to replace your remote. You can buy a new Roku remote from the Roku accessories store. Make sure your streaming device is listed as a compatible device before making a purchase.\nAdvanced tips for your Roku voice remote\nIf you have a Roku voice remote and are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku streaming device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network. If your router and streaming device both support 5GHz, enable the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network. Keep in mind that not all Roku streaming devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\n\n\nChange the wireless channel. When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually. To help you find un-congested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\nIf your streaming device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network. Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your streaming device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common.\nTo optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your streaming device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\n\nMove the router farther away. If your router is close to your streaming device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your streaming device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\nWarm or hot to touch\nIf the back of your Roku remote gets warm or hot during normal use, the rechargeable battery may be damaged or the alkaline batteries may be corroded.\n\nDiscontinue use of your remote.\nDisconnect your rechargeable remote from the charging cable.\nPlace remote on a hard non-flammable surface (like tile) and let it cool. Do not attempt to remove the alkaline batteries while hot!\n\n\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem.

This is also done through a pairing process which allows Bluetooth devices to register information about each other to make a secure wireless connection. Because this pairing information is retained even when Bluetooth devices are powered off, it is typically only necessary to pair your Bluetooth device one time.\nTo check if your smartphone, tablet, or computer is paired, open the Remotes & devices menu as described above, and then select Bluetooth devices. Look for your Bluetooth device by name as seen below.\n\n\n\nNote: The name that appears in the list is acquired from your Bluetooth device. You can typically change this by accessing the settings menu on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Refer to the manufacturer's online documentation for help.\n\nIf you do not see your Bluetooth device in the list, it is not paired. You must first pair your Bluetooth device to your Roku device before you can listen to audio from your smartphone, tablet, or computer.\nIf your Bluetooth device fails to pair:\n\n\nMake sure Bluetooth is enabled: Bluetooth must be turned on, or enabled on your Bluetooth device, and your device must not be in 'airplane mode'. With some devices, you may need to turn Bluetooth off, and then back on to get it to pair. For help using Bluetooth on your Bluetooth device, refer to the manufacturer's online resources or contact their support center. You can find links to some common manufacturers in the detailed article about connecting a Bluetooth device to your Roku device.\n\nCheck your wireless speakers or wireless soundbar: If you have Roku wireless speakers or a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, make sure it is powered on and working. When paired and connected, you will see it listed on the Remotes & devices menu as described earlier in this article. If your wireless speakers or wireless soundbar is not connected, you will not be able to pair a Bluetooth device.\n\nCheck that your Roku device is in pairing mode: Your Roku device must be in pairing mode to allow your smartphone, tablet, or computer to discover it. To enter pairing mode, go to Settings > Remotes & devices > Pair Bluetooth device.\n\nMove your device closer: Bluetooth allows devices to wirelessly exchange data over short distances (typically less than 30 feet). Try moving your Bluetooth device closer when attempting to pair.\n\nWait longer: If you do not see your Roku device in the list of discovered devices on your Bluetooth device, check that your Roku device is still in the Bluetooth pairing screen, and restart the scan on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Occasionally, Bluetooth devices take longer (30-60 seconds) to discover devices around them.\n\nRestart Bluetooth device: In some cases, restarting your Bluetooth device will get it to pair successfully.\n\nEliminate interference: If you already have a Bluetooth device paired and it is nearby, try powering it off if you are attempting to pair a second Bluetooth device.\n\nRepeat the pairing process: In the event that a device lost pairing information, delete pairing information on both your Bluetooth device and Roku device, and repeat the pairing process. To delete pairing information on your Bluetooth device, open the list of paired Bluetooth devices and remove, or 'forget' your Roku device. On your Roku device, go to Settings > Remotes & devices > Bluetooth devices to select your Bluetooth device, and then select Forget this device.\n\nProblems connecting your Bluetooth device\nAfter your Bluetooth device is paired, it must also be connected before you can stream audio to your compatible Roku device.\nWhen you initially pair your smartphone, tablet, or computer, it may also connect automatically to your Roku device. To check if your Bluetooth device is connected, open the Remotes & devices menu as described above and then select Bluetooth devices. Look for (Connected) next to your Bluetooth device as seen below.\n\nThis indicator lets you know your Bluetooth device is not only paired, but also connected to your Roku device, and is ready to use.\nIf your Bluetooth device is paired, but not connected:\n\n\nMake sure Bluetooth is enabled: Bluetooth must be turned on, or enabled on your Bluetooth device, and your device must not be in 'airplane mode'. With some devices, you may need to turn Bluetooth off and then back on to get it connected. For help using Bluetooth on your Bluetooth device, refer to the manufacturer's online resources or contact their support center. You can find links to some common manufacturers in the detailed article about connecting a Bluetooth device to your Roku audio device.\n\nSelect your Roku device: You may need to open the Bluetooth settings on your smartphone, tablet, or computer and connect to your Roku device from the list of paired devices. Often times, this is done by simply selecting your Roku device from the list. For help, visit the manufacturer's website, or refer to their online documentation.\n\nCheck your wireless speakers or wireless soundbar: If you have Roku wireless speakers or a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, make sure it is powered on and working. When paired and connected, you will see it listed on the Remotes & devices menu as described earlier in this article. If your wireless speakers or wireless soundbar is not connected, you will not be able to pair a Bluetooth device.\n\nMove your device closer: Bluetooth allows devices to wirelessly exchange data over short distances (typically less than 30 feet). Try moving your Bluetooth device closer when attempting to connect.\n\nRestart Bluetooth device: In some cases, restarting your Bluetooth device will get it to connect successfully.\n\nDisconnect another Bluetooth device: You can have multiple Bluetooth devices paired to your Roku device, but only one device can be connected at any time. Check that you do not have another Bluetooth device connected by looking at the list of Bluetooth devices on your Roku device. If another Bluetooth device has the (Connected) indicator next to it, try disabling Bluetooth on that device, power it off, or disconnect it from Bluetooth.\n\nRepeat the pairing process: In the event that a device lost pairing information, delete pairing information on both your Bluetooth device and Roku device, and repeat the pairing process. To delete pairing information on your Bluetooth device, open the list of paired Bluetooth devices and remove, or 'forget' your Roku device. On your Roku device, go to Settings > Remotes & devices > Bluetooth devices to select your Bluetooth device, and then select Forget this device.\n\nWhy do I not hear anything from my Bluetooth device?\nAfter your smartphone, tablet, or computer is paired and connected to your compatible Roku device, the Bluetooth channel should launch automatically. If it does not, you can manually open the Bluetooth channel by selecting the channel icon from the grid, issuing a voice command, or pressing a personal shortcut button on a compatible Roku remote.\n\n\nSelect the channel icon\nTo open the channel from your Home screen, use your Roku remote and navigate the channel grid with the directional pad. The directional pad is plus-shaped and is in the center of your remote. Once you find the Bluetooth channel, highlight it and press OK  to open it.\n\nIssue a voice command\nYou can open the Bluetooth channel with a voice command using the free Roku mobile app or a Roku voice remote. Simply press and hold the Voice button  and with a conversational tone at a normal volume, say something like \"launch the Bluetooth channel\" or \"open Bluetooth\". If you have a Roku Voice Remote Pro, you can also use hands-free voice to issue the same commands. Just remember to begin your request with \"Hey Roku...\". For help using voice commands, read more about using your voice to search and control your Roku device.\nCreate a personal shortcut button\nIf you plan to listen to Bluetooth audio frequently, you may want to program one of the personal shortcut buttons on select Roku voice remotes. To do this, issue a voice command as described above and wait a moment for the channel to open. Next, press and hold the personal shortcut button until you hear the success tone. The button is now programmed to launch the Bluetooth channel with a single touch. For help saving an often-used voice command, read more about creating a personal shortcut on your compatible voice remote.\n\n\nNote: A personal shortcut button can be re-assigned as many times as you like.\n\n\n\nAfter the Bluetooth channel is open and an app is playing music, a podcast, or other audio content on your Bluetooth device, you should hear sound after a moment. You will also see details on the TV screen about the music or podcast that is playing. If you see this information, but still do not hear sound, adjust the volume level making sure it is not muted or inaudible. You can also adjust the volume from your smartphone, tablet, or computer, but you will not see volume feedback on the TV screen like when you adjust the volume with a Roku remote or voice command.\n\n\nNote: When you adjust the volume from your Bluetooth device, there may be a slight delay until you hear a change in audio volume.\n\nOther issues when using your Bluetooth device\nBelow are some issues you may encounter when streaming Bluetooth audio:\n\n\nMissing song or podcast information: When audio begins streaming from your Bluetooth device, your TV screen may display the Bluetooth device name, track name, and artist name in that order. If this information is not appearing, it is possible that it is not being transmitted by your Bluetooth device. For example, this information is not sent when some Windows 10 laptops stream music, or when iOS\u00ae devices (e.g., iPhone) stream YouTube.\n\nPlaying content from a web browser: When you play content from a web browser on your smartphone, tablet, or computer, information about the music, podcast, or other audio will not be displayed in the Bluetooth channel. In addition, you cannot use a Roku remote to issue control commands such as pause or play, due to a lack of support for control information from a web browser over Bluetooth. In cases like this, you can view playback information and issue control commands from your smartphone, tablet, or computer, or download and use the standalone app.\n\nSkip back behavior: You may find that \"skip back\" or Rewind  on your Roku remote does not behave as you expect. This is because different brands and models of Bluetooth devices interpret \"skip back\" commands differently. Some skip back to the previous track, while others only skip back to beginning of the current track. It may be necessary to quickly press Rewind  two times to skip back to the previous track.\n\nWhy is the Bluetooth channel opening unexpectedly?\nIn rare cases, you may find the Bluetooth channel opens unexpectedly when your Bluetooth device connects and begins playing audio without you having initiated any action. To correct this behavior, you can manually disconnect your Bluetooth device each time this happens or turn off the Bluetooth auto-play feature altogether.\nManually disconnect your Bluetooth device\nWhen you disconnect a smartphone, tablet, or computer from your compatible Roku device, it remains in the My paired devices list as it is merely disconnected from the current Bluetooth session. You can use the steps below to manually disconnect your Bluetooth device should the Bluetooth channel open unexpectedly.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect Remotes & devices\n\nSelect Bluetooth devices\n\nSelect your Bluetooth device by name\n\n\nNote: The name that appears in the list is acquired from your Bluetooth device. You can typically change this name by accessing the settings menu on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Refer to the manufacturer's online documentation for help.\n\n\nSelect Disconnect\n\nOnce your Bluetooth device is disconnected, the Bluetooth channel will not launch automatically, and you will not be able to stream Bluetooth audio to your Roku device. You must re-connect your smartphone, tablet, or computer when you want to stream Bluetooth audio again.\nTurn off Bluetooth auto-play\nYou can turn the Bluetooth auto-play feature off (or on) only when the Bluetooth channel is open.\n\nIf it is not already open, launch the Bluetooth channel on your Roku device.\nPress Star  on your Roku remote to access playback options.\nScroll to highlight Bluetooth auto-play.\nSwitch the setting to Off (or On).\nRead more backgroundWith your compatible Roku", "doc_id": "bbaa5a9f-428b-4017-89af-b026ff333af4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ad4a20574ffc3ec8a0e1c16e17759dcf2df849a735476cb9b07cca7fba4a16ac", "extra_info": {"title": "How to resolve issues connecting a Bluetooth\u00ae device to your Roku\u00ae device | Official Roku Support", "length": 17091, "excerpt": "With your compatible Roku device, you can connect a smartphone, tablet, or computer via Bluetooth, a wireless communication technology that allows devices to", "byline": "Roku", "dir": null, "lang": "en", "siteName": "Roku"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 16173}, "relationships": {"1": "d049a90a-ce16-4456-b010-05f16c4c16a1", "3": "84ea4c6b-7ab4-4f2a-ba5a-011182b9f1d4"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84ea4c6b-7ab4-4f2a-ba5a-011182b9f1d4": {"text": "typically change this name by accessing the settings menu on your smartphone, tablet, or computer.

This is a simple process, but its important to understand a few things before you begin. This article provides more details about each surround sound connection, and explains how you can get the best performance with your Roku TV.\nSurround sound connections on your Roku TV\nWhen you connect your AVR or soundbar to your Roku TV, the type of connection you choose mainly depends on the available hardware connections and features of your AVR or soundbar. Some older audio devices may be incompatible with newer HDMI technologies, or may be limited to older optical audio connections. Use the descriptions below to determine what type of connections are available on your surround sound system. All Roku TV models have a type of HDMI ARC connection and a digital audio output.\n\n\nDigital audio output\n\nThis connection is typically labeled \"Digital audio out\" or \"Digital output\", and is sometimes referred to as S/PDIF or optical. To make the connection, you will use an optical cable, sometimes called a TOSLINK cable.\n\n\n\nNote: When using an optical cable, be sure to remove the protective plastic cap from each end of the cable before inserting the connectors. Failing to do so may result in a faulty connection, or damage to the cable or optical port.\n\n\nHDMI ARC\n\nThe HDMI ARC (or Audio Return Channel) connection is located among the other HDMI ports, and is often labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or just \"ARC\". When connecting your surround sound system using ARC, you will use an HDMI cable.\nHDMI eARC (select Roku TV models only)\n\nThe HDMI eARC (or Enhanced Audio Return Channel) connection is located with the other HDMI ports, and is commonly labeled \"HDMI eARC\" or simply \"eARC\". To take advantage of eARC, you need to use a High Speed HDMI Cable with support for Ethernet.\n\n\nNote: HDMI eARC is only available on select Roku TV models.\n\n\n\nIf you are setting up a 4K Ultra HD or HDR device with your compatible Roku TV, you need to use a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable to get a 4K Ultra HD or HDR image when using ARC. For eARC, you need a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet, or an Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable (which does include Ethernet support).\nIf you are setting up an 8K Ultra HD or HDR device with your compatible Roku TV, you need to use an Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable to get an 8K Ultra HD or HDR image when using ARC or eARC.\nBenefits of HDMI ARC\nThe HDMI ARC connection provides a number of benefits over the digital audio output, including those described below.\n\n\nLess clutter - With a single cable, HDMI ARC uses two-way communication to send sound to your AVR or soundbar, while simultaneously sending picture to your Roku TV. There is no need for separate audio and video cables.\n\nControl other devices - Using only your Roku TV remote, you can control aspects of your home theater like adjusting the volume and muting the sound.\n\nSupport for more surround sound formats - The HDMI ARC connection supports the same formats as the digital audio output, but with greater throughput, it also supports advanced formats like Dolby Digital PlusTM and Dolby Atmos\u00ae. The S/PDIF connection is limited to 2 channels of uncompressed stereo sound (PCM), or 5.1 channels of compressed surround sound (Dolby DigitalTM or DTS\u00ae).\n\nHDMI eARC advancements\nWith significantly greater throughput, HDMI eARC offers support for advanced surround sound formats with higher audio quality. In addition to the formats S/PDIF and ARC support, the newer eARC connection adds support for full-resolution uncompressed audio formats like DTS-HD Master AudioTM, DTS:X\u00ae, Dolby\u00ae TrueHD, and Dolby Atmos.\n\n\nNote: Dolby Atmos is supported on ARC, but only in a compressed format. HDMI eARC supports Dolby Atmos in a higher quality uncompressed format.\n\nWith faster data transfer and increased bandwidth, eARC also has built-in audio and video \"lip-sync\", which was an optional feature in the original ARC specification.\nTo take advantage of these advancements, both your Roku TV and AVR or soundbar must have an eARC connection. If one of your devices does not support eARC, you can still use HDMI ARC, but the device that supports eARC will not be able to use any of the enhanced features.\n\n\nNote: HDMI eARC is only available on select Roku TV models.\n\nAs mentioned above, you also need to make the connection using a High Speed HDMI Cable with support for Ethernet, like an Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable.\nWhat to check before using ARC or eARC\nBefore you connect your surround sound system using ARC or eARC, you should check to make sure HDMI ARC (or eARC) is enabled along with an HDMI feature called CEC (or Consumer Electronics Control). With CEC enabled, you can use your Roku TV remote to adjust the volume and mute the sound of your home theater, and display the volume level and mute status on the TV screen. You can find these settings on your Roku TV using the instructions below. If you need help finding the CEC and ARC settings on your AVR or soundbar, visit the manufacturer's online resources or contact them directly.\nTo enable ARC (or eARC):\n\nPress Home  on your Roku TV remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Control other devices (CEC)\n\nScroll and highlight ARC (or eARC)\nCheck the box using OK  on your remote to enable ARC (or eARC)\n\nTo enable CEC:\n\nPerform ARC steps 1 through 4 above\nScroll and highlight System audio control\n\nCheck the box to enable System audio control\n\nHighlight 1-touch play\n\nCheck the box to enable 1-touch play\n\n\nIf you want to learn more, refer to the detailed article about enabling CEC and ARC on your TV.\nHow to adjust surround sound settings on your Roku TV\nYou can configure various surround sound settings on your Roku TV in the S/PDIF and ARC menu using the instructions below.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku TV remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Audio\n\nSelect S/PDIF and ARC and make a selection\n\n\nAuto detect - This is the default setting that allows your Roku TV to automatically detect the capabilities of your surround sound system over the HDMI connection.\n\n\nAuto passthrough - Delivers unmodified Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, or DTS audio when available with the movie or TV show and when your Roku TV detects that your surround sound system supports the audio format.\n\n\nNote: The Auto passthrough setting allows an AVR or soundbar with appropriate capabilities to play content without any delay due to processing in the TV. When Auto passthrough is enabled, audio formats that are not supported by the AVR or soundbar may be converted to stereo sound (PCM) to keep any processing delay to a minimum.\n\n\n\nSpecific audio formats - Choose one of the specific audio formats if the audio capabilities of your AVR or soundbar is not detected correctly, and you know it supports the specific audio format(s).\n\n\n\nRead more backgroundBefore you can enjoy your favorite streaming content in surround sound, you must connect your audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar to your Roku TV using an HDMI\u00ae cable or optical cable.

It may also be pre-installed on some Roku\u00ae streaming devices. Roku Media Player allows you to watch your own personal video files, listen to your music files, and view your photos using the Roku device\u2019s USB port (if available) or by accessing a media server on your local network.\nPlaying content stored on a USB drive\nSome Roku devices include a USB port to which you can connect an external USB drive for the purpose of playing locally stored photo, audio, and video files. You can connect more than one USB drive to your Roku device by connecting them to a USB hub.\nYou can use the Roku device comparison chart to determine which current products include a USB port.\nUSB drives may be formatted with different file systems. Roku Media Player supports drives that are formatted with the FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, EXT2, EXT3, and HFS+ file systems. You can also access different partitions on the USB drive.\nInsert the USB device into the USB port on your Roku device. If Roku Media Player is not installed, you will be prompted to add it from the Roku Channel Store. If the channel is installed, an on-screen prompt will ask you to launch Roku Media Player.\n\n\nNote: You can change how your Roku device behaves when a USB device is inserted by visiting Settings > System > USB media.\n\nIf you are in Roku Media Player when the USB device is inserted, a USB Drive icon should show up in the media device selection screen.\n\nYou can access this screen by selecting All from the main screen. If you do not see the icon, learn what to do if Roku Media Player does not detect the USB device.\nSearching for content on your USB drive\nBefore you can search your USB drive, Roku Media Player must first build a database of your content. It does this automatically as you navigate each folder, or you can manually trigger a scan of all files using the steps described below.\n\nLaunch Roku Media Player\nSelect the icon for All, Video, Audio, or Photo\n\nOn the Select Media device screen, make sure the icon for your USB drive is highlighted in the center of your screen\nPress Star  on your Roku remote to display information about your USB drive.\nSelect Scan\n\n\nNote: If Roku Media Player already built a database of the content on your USB drive, Scan may not appear.\n\n\n\nA scan may take several minutes depending on the number of files on your USB drive, and canceling the operation early will cause results to be lost. When the scan finishes, results are stored in the memory of your Roku device. If your Roku device has a micro SD slot, and a micro SD card is installed when a scan completes, results will also be saved there making them available each time you start Roku Media Player with the same USB drive.\n\n\nNote: Currently, only genre, artist, album, and song are extracted from audio files during a scan. You can, however, search by filename for any file.\n\nAfter Roku Media Player finishes building the database, you can perform a media search using the steps below.\n\nSelect the icon for your USB drive\nPress Star  on your Roku remote\nSelect Search to access the Search screen\nBegin entering the first few letters of your search and available results will begin to appear. As you complete the word or phrase, results will narrow.\n\n\nNote: Previous searches appear before you enter any text.\n\n\nSelect a result to search for media on your USB drive. Results will be displayed in the current folder view.\n\nAfter the database of content has been created, you can select Audio as the media type to see new folders appear at the top level on the navigation screen. When you select <by Genre>, <by Artist>, or <by Album>, you can view your audio content organized by the respective tags embedded in each file.\nPlaying content on your local area network\nDLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) is a standard technology that enables sharing of content between devices connected over a network. To play content stored on another device or computer on your Roku device using DLNA, the other device must be running DLNA server software and must be on the same network as your Roku device. Some routers and NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices have a built in DLNA server.\nRoku Media Player has been tested to work with the following DLNA servers:\n\nWindows Media Player/Center\nServiio\nPlex\nTwonky\nMiniDLNA/ReadyDLNA/ReadyMedia\nPlayOn\nSynology (DSM 6.2.1)\n\nFor information on setting up a DLNA server, consult the associated online support site.\nSearching for content on your network\nSome DLNA servers support media searches, typically for genre, artist, album, and song. You can use the USB drive steps described above to search such a DLNA server.\n\n\nNote: If you do not see an option to Search, the DLNA server does not support media search.\n\nSupported media file types\nDifferent Roku devices support different formats. Newer firmware may support additional formats. The type of audio formats supported is dependent on the type of TV or A/V receiver (AVR) your Roku device is connected to. Formats supported by your Roku device can be viewed by accessing the ?/Help pages from the Media Device and the Media Type selection screens.\nThe following file formats are supported:\n\n\nVideo \u2013 H.264/AVC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV)\n\nAudio \u2013 AAC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV); MP3(.MP3, .MKV); FLAC (.FLAC, .MKV), PCM (.WAV, .MKV, .MP4, .MOV), AC3/EAC3 (.MKV,.MP4. .MOV, .AC3), DTS (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV,.DTS), ALAC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV, .M4A), Vorbis (.OGG,.MKV,.WEBM)\n\nPlaylists \u2013.M3U, .M3U8, .PLS\n\nImage \u2013 JPG, PNG, GIF (non-animated)\n\nThe following media formats are supported on Roku devices that support 4K\n\n\n4K Video \u2013 H.265/HEVC (.MKV, .MP4, .MOV); VP9 (.MKV, .WEBM) and AV1 (.MKV, MP4) on some Roku devices\n\n4K Video \u2013 H.264 (Roku Premiere, Premiere+, and Ultra only)\n\nThe following media formats are supported on Roku devices that support 8K\n\n\n8K Video \u2013 AV1 (.MKV, MP4) and H.265/HEVC (.MKV, .MP4)\n\nThe following media formats are supported on Roku TV models and some Roku players\n\n\nVideo \u2013 H.262 (.MKV)\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe Roku Media Player channel will not display unsupported file types or files it has determined cannot be played by your Roku device.\nDRM-protected content is not supported.\n\n\n\nSupport for 5.1 AC3/E-AC3 (Dolby Digital)\nMany Roku players can decode Dolby DigitalTM (AC3) audio. Some can also decode Dolby Digital PlusTM (E-AC3), but others cannot decode either. If you are trying to play Dolby AudioTM (AC3, E-AC3), but do not hear multi-channel surround sound, try connecting your Roku player via HDMI\u00ae or S/PDIF (optical) to a TV or AVR capable of decoding Dolby AudioTM. Your Roku player will pass-through the encoded Dolby Audio to the TV or AVR for decoding.\nSome Roku players can decode Dolby Digital Plus to HDMI and S/PDIF TOSLINK (optical). This means that content encoded with Dolby Digital Plus will be transcoded (converted) into Dolby Digital if your AVR does not support Dolby Digital Plus, but does support Dolby Digital 5.1.\nRoku TV models support transcoding Dolby Digital Plus to Dolby Digital for the S/PDIF (optical) and ARC (Audio Return Channel) connectors, allowing you to connect your TV audio to an AVR that supports Dolby Digital 5.1 (but not Dolby Digital Plus).\n\n\nNote: Dolby TrueHD and lossless Dolby are not supported.\n\nSupport for 5.1 DTS\nRoku devices will only pass-through DTS audio. To decode multi-channel surround sound, you must connect your Roku device via HDMI or S/PDIF (optical) to a TV or AVR capable of decoding DTS.\n\n\nNote: DTS-HD and lossless DTS are not supported.\n\nSupport for AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)\nRoku devices do not support AAC pass-through. Instead, Stereo AAC is transcoded to PCM stereo.\nRoku TV models and some Roku players decode 5.1 AAC to PCM stereo for headphone, internal speaker, and HDMI/ S/PDIF (optical) output. However, Roku devices that support Dolby Audio decode connected via HDMI or S/PDIF (optical) to an AVR that also supports Dolby Audio, will convert the audio to Dolby Digital 5.1.\nHow to play music, photos, or video using Roku Media PlayerConvert videos to play with Roku Media PlayerSome DLNA servers, such as Plex, Serviio, WMP, and some Synology devices will automatically convert (transcode) the video to a format supported by the Roku device. If you are using a DLNA server that does not support transcoding, or you are playing directly from a USB drive, you may need to convert the files first. There are several applications available for converting videos.Provide your own poster artwork for videos on a USB driveYou can add your own artwork for a video by creating a JPG, THM, or PNG file with the same name as the video, and copying it to the same folder as the video on the USB drive.Support for movie subtitlesRoku Media Player supports embedded subtitles in .mkv files. To choose a subtitle track use Star  while the video is playing. If you have a Roku TV, you also need to select Accessibility. Roku Media Player will automatically include subtitle tracks found in .SRT and .VTT files. The files must be saved in the same folder as the video. They must have the same name as the video and the .srt or .vtt extension. To include multiple files you must insert a language extension, for example movie.eng.srt or movie.ger.srt.Support for playlistsRoku Media Player supports .pls, .m3u and .m3u8 playlists on a USB drive. The media in the playlist should have an extension that indicates the media type, for example .mp3, .mkv, .jpg, etc. Playlist entries can also point to a URL. Make sure the URL begins with http:// and the extension should indicate the media type. If the playlist entry does not have a recognizable extension, it will be treated as a video and will try to detect the actual media type when it starts playing. Some DLNA servers will convert playlist files to folders that the Roku Media Player can access using DLNA.Creating USB drive that will auto start a slideshow, music playback, or a movieCreate a playlist file called Autostart.m3u in the root of the USB device. Put entries in that file that point to the media you want automatically played on your Roku. Set the Roku to auto-launch Roku Media Player when a USB device is inserted by going to the Settings > System > USB media menu. If you want to disable automatic playback, you can disable it the main Settings menu of Roku Media Player.Setting a favorite DLNA server\nYou can set up Roku Media Player to go directly into your favorite DLNA server each time the channel is launched (if there is no USB drive).\n\nHighlight the icon for your favorite DLNA server from the Media Device screen\nPress Star \n\nSelect Set Favorite DLNA server\n\n\nChange the navigation styleDisable album artwork lookup when accessing mp3 files on a USB drive\nYou can change whether the USB player attempts to find album artwork on the web when reading .mp3 audio files.

This allows you to start music playback or control your Roku device from a nearby location that may not be in direct line of sight, such as an entryway table or kitchen counter.\nDuring setup, your Roku Touch attempts to establish a connection with your Roku device through a process called \u201cpairing\u201d. When you select Settings > Remotes & devices > Set up a new device > Remote, your Roku device begins searching for a remote to pair. When it finds your Roku Touch, you will see a message like the one below when pairing.\n\nAlternatively, if you restart your Roku device, it will enter pairing mode for a few moments looking for a remote to pair. If you press the pairing button located in the battery compartment of your Roku Touch during this time, you will see a message similar to the one below.\n\nIn either case, when the pairing process completes, your Roku Touch is ready to use.\nWhy is my Roku Touch not working?\nIf your Roku Touch tabletop remote is not working as expected (e.g., you are unable to control your Roku device, your remote is not pairing, pressing buttons does nothing), use the troubleshooting steps below to help resolve the issue.\n\n\nRestart your Roku device and remote\n\nOpen the battery compartment and remove the batteries from your remote.\nRemove the power cable from your Roku device, wait 5 seconds and then re-connect the power cable.\n\n\nTip: Roku TVTM models and Roku players (with the exception of a Roku Streaming Stick\u00ae) can be controlled with a Roku simple (IR) remote. If you also have this type of remote, you can use it to access the Settings menu and restart your Roku device with the following steps (rather than unplugging it).\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\n\nSelect System\n\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen your Roku device displays the home screen, reinsert the batteries in your remote.\nWait at least 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes a connection with your Roku device.\n\n\n\nRe-pair the remote\n\nOpen the battery compartment and remove the batteries from your remote.\nRemove the power cable from your Roku device, wait 5 seconds and then re-connect the power cable.\nWhen your Roku device displays the home screen, reinsert the batteries in your remote.\nPress and hold the pairing button inside the battery compartment of your remote for 5 seconds or until you see the pairing light on the remote begin to flash. If the light does not flash, try again. If the light still does not flash, then you should replace the batteries (see below).\nWait for 30 seconds while the remote establishes a connection with your Roku device.\nThe remote pairing dialog should appear on your TV screen.\n\n\n\nReplace the batteries\n\nOpen the battery compartment and remove the old batteries from the remote.\nRemove the power cable from the Roku device, wait 5 seconds and then re-connect the power cable.\nWhen the Roku device displays the first screen, insert new batteries.\nWait for 30 seconds while the remote establishes a connection with your Roku device.\nThe remote pairing dialog should appear on your TV screen.\n\n\n\nInstall a HDMI extension cable (Streaming Stick only)\n\nWhen using a Roku Streaming Stick that can be connected directly to an HDMI\u00ae port on your TV, wireless interference from the HDMI connector may impact the performance of your remote.\nIf this is the type of Roku device you own, try moving it away from the HDMI connector on your TV by installing an HDMI extension cable to connect your Streaming Stick to your TV. You can order a free HDMI extension cable on the Roku website.\n\n\n\nReplace the remote\n\nIf none of the above steps solve your problem, you may need to replace your remote.\nIf you are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can try the pro tips below before you replace your remote.\nYou can buy a new Roku remote from the Roku accessories store. Make sure your Roku device is listed as a compatible device before making a purchase.\n\n\n\nPro tips\nIf you are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network: If your router and Roku device both support 5GHz, make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network.\n\n\nNote: Not all Roku devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the wireless channel: When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\n\n\n\nIf your Roku device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network: Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your Roku device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common. Additionally, if your 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless networks have different network names, your Roku device will only be able to connect to the 2.4GHz wireless network.To optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your Roku device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\nMove the router farther away: If your router is close to your Roku device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your Roku device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\nWarm or hot to touch\nIf the back of your Roku remote gets warm or hot during normal use, the rechargeable battery may be damaged or the alkaline batteries may be corroded.\n\nDiscontinue use of your remote.\nDisconnect your rechargeable remote from the charging cable.\nPlace remote on a hard non-flammable surface (like tile) and let it cool. Do not attempt to remove the alkaline batteries while hot!\n\n\n*A note on terminology:\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.", "doc_id": "28013c42-da60-4eee-a8c3-540e1ed604e4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "170c72f15febe0affafacb054d0f4e4c58b3bb6c70a13c8240b0e5769f0421bb", "extra_info": {"title": "How to resolve an issue with your Roku Touch\u2122 tabletop remote | Official Roku Support", "length": 9170, "excerpt": "Remote issues differ based on the type of Roku\u00ae remote.
