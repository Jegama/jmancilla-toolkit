# Introduction

This repository contains the code for a set of tools that are deployed on a Google Cloud Run and are used on my website [jgmancilla.com](https://www.jgmancilla.com/). The tools are:

- My representative which is featured on the homepage of my website. I used RAG (Retrival Augmented Generation), indexing my resume and both of my portfolios ([research](https://www.jgmancilla.com/research-portfolio), and [machine learning](https://www.jgmancilla.com/ml-portfolio)).
- The [Customer Support Bot](https://www.jgmancilla.com/customer-support-bot-project) which also uses RAG to answer questions from the [Roku Support Site](https://support.roku.com/).

## Other projects

- **[Research Librarian](https://www.jgmancilla.com/research-librarian)**: The Research Librarian project was a groundbreaking initiative to develop an AI-powered index for UX and CI research. By leveraging advanced AI techniques similar to the [Calvinist Parrot](https://www.jgmancilla.com/calvinist-parrot) project, the aim was to enhance internal accessibility and search capabilities. This tool was envisioned as a dynamic solution to deepen users' understanding and interactions with the company's research data.
- **[Modular Survey Report Generator](https://www.jgmancilla.com/modular-survey-report-generator)**: I conceptualized, designed, and developed an upgraded version of our report generator that harnesses machine learning to analyze a wide array of surveys autonomously. The Modular Survey Analysis System I created has profoundly transformed the survey data analysis process, offering unprecedented flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.
