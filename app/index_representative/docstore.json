The initial version utilized a duo of AI agents, Parrot and Calvin, to provide insightful and accurate responses to user queries on religious texts. The chatbot was envisioned as a tool and a learning companion that continually evolves to enhance user interactions and deepen their understanding of religious texts.\n\nGOAL\n\nEngineer an AI-driven chatbot capable of providing thoughtful, accurate, and insightful responses to queries about the Bible from a Reformed theology standpoint.\nContinually enhance the AI's comprehension and response capabilities to foster a more profound exploration of Scriptures for users.\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\nInitially, the solution entailed the development of an AI chatbot employing two GPT agents working in tandem, with responses curated and calibrated to align with the principles of Reformed theology. A feedback loop was incorporated to allow for continuous learning and improvement based on user feedback.\nVersion 2.0 Enhancements:\n\nTo significantly reduce hallucinations and provide a more enriched user experience, the Calvinist Parrot evolved into an autonomous agent utilizing 11 distinct query engines to search through the vast Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL). GPT-3.5 powers the query engines, while the primary agent leverages the capabilities of GPT-4.\n\nLibrary Indexing and Categorization: One of the major challenges was indexing the extensive library, which led to the creation of a novel algorithm (patent in process) for analyzing books, generating multiple categories, and forming numerous query engines. This was a monumental step towards making the vast amount of religious texts accessible and searchable.\n\nAutonomous Query Execution: The autonomous agent now decides on the most appropriate query engine to respond to user queries, significantly enhancing the chatbot's ability to provide accurate and insightful responses.\n\nFINDINGS\n\nThe advancements in version 2.0 yielded notable results:\n\nReduction in Hallucinations: The utilization of multiple query engines significantly reduced hallucinations, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the chatbot's responses.\nImproved Response Depth: By accessing the extensive Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL) through tailored query engines, the chatbot could provide more insightful and well-informed responses to users' inquiries regarding Reformed theology and biblical texts.\nEnhanced User Experience: The autonomous nature of the updated chatbot, aided by the innovative indexing algorithm, delivered a more enriched user experience by providing quicker and more precise answers to a broader range of queries.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nThe evolution of the Calvinist Parrot project emphasized several technical and innovative breakthroughs:\n\nAlgorithm Development: Creating a novel algorithm for indexing and categorizing a massive library was a crucial breakthrough. This algorithm was instrumental in organizing the extensive Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL) into manageable and searchable categories.\nAutonomous Query Execution: Engineering an autonomous agent capable of selecting the appropriate query engine demonstrated a significant technical advancement, paving the way for more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\nMulti-Container and Multi-Build Architecture for Performance Optimization: The Calvinist Parrot project employed a robust multi-container and multi-build approach, where each Docker container housed a distinct query engine. This architectural strategy was pivotal in managing the extensive library effectively without resorting to larger-than-necessary instances. Optimized performance was achieved by segregating different sections of the library into individual containers and employing a multi-build approach for processing. This led to faster response times, lower resource utilization, and a streamlined user experience.

I aimed to create a 'Solution Spotlight' feature that offered users clear and concise responses to their queries. This approach would reduce the workload on the call center, improve self-service, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction. This AI agent is powered by advanced ML technology, including embeddings and GPT-3.5, and is supported by an all-encompassing index of all the articles available on a Customer Support site. This innovative approach ensures that users receive prompt, accurate, and relevant responses to their inquiries without human intervention.\n\nGOAL\nDevelop an autonomous agent that can provide a 'solution spotlight' - a curated 'best answer' - to user queries.\nImprove customer self-service and reduce the number of calls to the call center.\n\nSOLUTIONS\nThis solution involved the development of an autonomous agent using LangChain, a powerful tool. Our first step was indexing all the Customer Support site articles and creating a comprehensive library catalog. With over 322 articles indexed, our system thoroughly understood the available content. \n\nNext, we employed \"embeddings\" to search for the most relevant content. Embeddings are numerical representations of words or phrases that capture their meaning. Whenever a user asks a question, we transform it into this numerical form and then search for the article with the closest matching numerical representation. \n\nOnce we've identified the most relevant article, we use an advanced AI model GPT-3.5 to generate a response. This AI has been trained on a vast amount of text from the internet and can generate human-like responses based on the information it has been trained on.\n\nFINDINGS\nThe main findings from this project were: TBD.\nThe autonomous agent successfully provided relevant and accurate responses to user queries, improving customer self-service.\nThe 'Solution Spotlight' feature was well-received by users, resulting in a noticeable reduction in calls to the call center.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\nThrough this project, I learned about the significance of employing advanced AI technologies to enhance customer support and the effectiveness of autonomous agents in dealing with customer inquiries. It also underscored the importance of a comprehensive indexing system for support articles and the usefulness of embeddings in searching for the most relevant information.

An algorithm was used to identify windows where the participant was experiencing stress and validated using participant self-report.\n\nPaper: Eliciting Driver Stress Using Naturalistic Driving Scenarios on Real Roads.\n\nGOAL\nPropose instrumentation that could be used to measure the driver experience and its validity for analysis.\nValidate a stress elicitation technique that could be replicated on the road and safe for drivers.\nModified display with low battery warnings.\n\nSOLUTIONS\nThe proposed approach was a mixed methodology, where the participant behavior was quantified using psychophysiological measurements and validated with interviews before, during, and after the experiment.\n\nThe experimental design can be described as follows: Participants drive up a windy, secluded mountain road with poor cellular reception. They are told that they have plenty of charge for the study. Unbeknownst to the driver, we installed an experimental display that gives visual and auditory warnings of low battery charge 15 minutes into their drive. After 22 minutes of driving, the screen shows' empty', and the car demands to pull over to the side of the road. At this point, the driver attempts to call the research team.\n\nAn open API of the algorithm was released.\n\nFINDINGS\nThe two main results were:\nThe eliciting technique was successfully replicated, and 90% of participants experienced stress.\n89% of the stress events were correlated with road events.\n\nGiven the nature of these kinds of experiments, having scripted and unscripted events gives a better picture of how automotive drivers react to different stimuli.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\nThis experiment's biggest takeaways were having open communication with everyone involved and driving meaningful research in all stages, particularly with the follow-up.

Each Docker container housing a distinct query engine and a multi-build approach underscored the project's focus on performance optimization and resource efficiency. This technical initiative has significantly reduced response hallucinations and enriched the chatbot\u2019s response depth, showcasing a harmonious blend of theological inquiry and cutting-edge technology.\n\nMODULAR SURVEY ANALYSIS SYSTEM\n\nI developed the Modular Survey Analysis System, an evolution of the initial survey report generator. This new system streamlined the process by moving away from a static, hard-coded approach to a more dynamic, modular method, ensuring efficient categorization of diverse questions. A significant part of this project was integrating context-aware logic and enhancing the data interpretation process. One of the key components I'm particularly proud of is the autonomous clustering algorithm designed for open-ended responses. Currently, in the patenting process, this algorithm demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing a common challenge in survey analysis.\n\nThe development process presented several challenges. One such challenge was the inconsistency in the survey data due to its diverse nature. I addressed this by incorporating precise preprocessing techniques, ensuring data uniformity. Additionally, I encountered surveys with complex logic and dependencies. To tackle this, I designed a logic parser that effectively managed these intricacies. The open-ended responses, inherently subjective, were another challenge. My solution, the clustering algorithm, effectively categorizes and describes these responses, underscoring my dedication to creating efficient and reliable solutions.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT BOT\nI aimed to improve customer support with the help of cutting-edge AI technology. I developed an autonomous agent that could provide prompt and concise responses to user queries, thereby reducing the workload on our call center and improving self-service for our users. \n\nI used advanced AI technologies like embeddings and GPT-3.5 to power the agent. I also created a comprehensive index of all the articles on a CS site, in this case, Roku, to ensure users could easily access the most relevant information. The development process involved indexing all the support site articles and creating a library catalog.

The challenges are the same in both worlds: communication is vital for success. One of the most successful projects across multiple companies has been the standardization of reports and consolidation, leading to higher visibility for the research team across numerous teams.\n\nSOLUTION\nOne of the most common problems I have encountered is that highly skilled people often don't have the necessary visibility to present their results. Having a centralized tool to share the information and the findings has been advantageous to show progress and increase collaboration. \n\nHowever, adoption has been an issue on different occasions. Not everyone is on board to try new things; I have handled this to do a progressive rollout. I start with my immediate team, where I have a better rapport with the researchers, and I present it as a \"pilot,\" with no strings attached. Once the first results and improvements started to surface, I onboarded more teams to leverage the research team's work for the rest of the UX org. \n\nRESULTS\nThe results were noteworthy. The team created a repository with all the research and once it started getting traction with the rest of the teams across the org, looking through our knowledge base became self-served. \n\nAnother advantage was the visualization tools; it helped the leadership glance at the projects' current state. As a result, it a result, it a result, it helps them make informed decisions about where the project lacks or needs more resources. For example, the visualization below helps them to know what projects need more attention on a given day.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\nThe added process and documentation needed to standardize the team's work is a complicated hurdle to overcome.

In addition, it solidified our research, which led to a change in the direction of some decisions taken before having the data.\n\nGiven that this project continued intermittently for two years, having well-documented research and moderator guides and scripting the statistical analysis to optimize the work proved critical to delivering valuable results to our stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"bff3e1a0-2c1f-4a1e-9844-6d59fa170193": {"doc_hash": "a3f337be237d716b2c154da467cd5e706b64e50b26ec5b661f8241e2035c054f"}, "e9a58dc5-aeb1-4694-9e53-ba0651d8cf38": {"doc_hash": "ba6c099fd221e65856a5a22d367c51753e9cc9b1fdb0ee2b5d9a5c3222915035"}, "9afa6312-9c5c-4f0b-b777-4797069e7716": {"doc_hash": "174ca6c218e187e3b2223acd24069b6a0077900fdab2f8ac311d283be0ac4f7c"}, "9c275392-befb-4213-ac6c-74c7f3abc124": {"doc_hash": "743a315b06794033bf3175bd152751d5aac96f34e8ce0f173acd894c3c79953f"}, "77f71156-969d-471d-a026-d30b80c20a78": {"doc_hash": "6a7d0040be684974f691806aaaefb60c0431625a5facb4bd98a382a0005db5d9"}, "d1e9927b-ebb6-4e7e-9178-0e06e7179f9a": {"doc_hash": "7a45b4cad1e371de37132c5f6e944f9c1470e3ee0ec70ed04464297e4a76630d"}, "f64f1a3c-635f-4d2c-9dbb-01ca5976a77c": {"doc_hash": "27e39df306a6a262bcf79e84a57250020993840074d52c349e349776198bed33"}, "220a2639-c733-4c10-bc18-653a2ae3ac7d": {"doc_hash": "12933b17127c9cc402af9cdfd5efbae7fa4e690eb836395c142c954844ef9bf7"}, "90cbe46c-4820-4f39-a54a-d56df63baf1f": {"doc_hash": "9fb777e856eebe0caf71fb5a75cf2a830ab2cf2df1f38d043caf8b992644a555"}}}
