They are told that they have plenty of charge for the study. Unbeknownst to the driver, we installed an experimental display that gives visual and auditory warnings of low battery charge 15 minutes into their drive. After 22 minutes of driving, the screen shows' empty', and the car demands to pull over to the side of the road. At this point, the driver attempts to call the research team.\n\nAn open API of the algorithm was released.\n\nFINDINGS\nThe two main results were:\nThe eliciting technique was successfully replicated, and 90% of participants experienced stress.\n89% of the stress events were correlated with road events.\n\nGiven the nature of these kinds of experiments, having scripted and unscripted events gives a better picture of how automotive drivers react to different stimuli.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\nThis experiment's biggest takeaways were having open communication with everyone involved and driving meaningful research in all stages, particularly with the follow-up.

While this remote control was under hardware testing, I evaluated our remote controls, adding the button presses recorded during the studies. \n\nWhile evaluating other remote controls, additional features not previously included in the metrics were added, given that they are exclusive to some remotes. This evaluation included country-specific metrics and a dashboard to gauge the different behaviors per country and between remote controls, which have distinct features.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\nCollaborating with the designers and PMs was valuable in understanding what was most meaningful for them. In addition, it solidified our research, which led to a change in the direction of some decisions taken before having the data.\n\nGiven that this project continued intermittently for two years, having well-documented research and moderator guides and scripting the statistical analysis to optimize the work proved critical to delivering valuable results to our stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"d7b13f19-d9a6-4d21-a06a-2a0424ceeea5": {"doc_hash": "a3f337be237d716b2c154da467cd5e706b64e50b26ec5b661f8241e2035c054f"}, "0c27265b-9883-48ee-8919-2634aee1e2af": {"doc_hash": "ba6c099fd221e65856a5a22d367c51753e9cc9b1fdb0ee2b5d9a5c3222915035"}, "f76cc6e9-22f6-4459-b811-15a70b41b335": {"doc_hash": "174ca6c218e187e3b2223acd24069b6a0077900fdab2f8ac311d283be0ac4f7c"}, "78996bc6-b4c9-4658-8ca7-19cac3d89aaa": {"doc_hash": "ff44ec513cee073739596572a624ea2fda6257b1a5121d1a4c5c5d4b091b051a"}, "94d685f2-6514-4e8b-bfee-ae92a30229a3": {"doc_hash": "7cbd7a6ea13cea2ce9dfe586dd08bc35bb7ca651a5b30d9405982ed65e26ec76"}, "a6bd5f17-90b2-4840-aaf5-fd8d71881b42": {"doc_hash": "6a7d0040be684974f691806aaaefb60c0431625a5facb4bd98a382a0005db5d9"}, "2b1b27dc-b6ba-4113-9aa9-dda3e9cbe46d": {"doc_hash": "7a45b4cad1e371de37132c5f6e944f9c1470e3ee0ec70ed04464297e4a76630d"}, "4cde2be4-565a-4862-b6cf-8f2b090fe820": {"doc_hash": "0d29b1b012b0bb9ec1787c53ff830ea0752584c58328f0ef9e5346e9a790b823"}, "c152b8a4-d043-4750-b5ac-a5e70c780f40": {"doc_hash": "12933b17127c9cc402af9cdfd5efbae7fa4e690eb836395c142c954844ef9bf7"}, "5623bca1-330d-4da0-99b8-e464c4432830": {"doc_hash": "9fb777e856eebe0caf71fb5a75cf2a830ab2cf2df1f38d043caf8b992644a555"}}}
