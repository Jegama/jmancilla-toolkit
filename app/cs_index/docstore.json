Your streaming device scans all available networks and presents a list that is ordered by strength of the Wi-Fi\u00ae signal. The smart home app relies on a connection to your wireless network to set up and add your smart home devices. The wireless network name, sometimes called the SSID, is either the default name that was set by your ISP or router manufacturer, or the name you chose when you set up your wireless network.\n\nHelp for your streaming device\nHow to find your wireless network name\n\nTo stream movies and TV shows on your streaming device, you must have a connection to the internet. If you plan to use the Roku mobile app to control your streaming device, it is important these devices are connected to the same network. To make sure your streaming device is connected to the correct network, use the guidelines below.\n\nCheck to see what network your computer or mobile device is connected to. This information is typically found in the settings for your device, often in a section titled \"Network\", \"Network & Internet\", \"Wi-Fi\", or something similar. Your Roku streaming device should be connected to the same wireless network.\nIf you do not see your network name on the list of available networks in the \u201cChoose your network\u201d screen when connecting your streaming device, select Scan again to see all networks. This will rescan for Wi-Fi signals and present a list of all networks that are available.\nIf you cannot remember the name of your wireless network, go to the support site for your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. Also, sometimes the default name is listed on the bottom of the router.\nHow to get your wireless password\nEnter the same wireless password that you use to connect your computer or mobile device to your home network.\nIf you have forgotten the password, go to the support site for your ISP or router manufacturer. They will be able to suggest the specific methods for their products to recover the password or reset it. Sometimes the default password is listed on the bottom of the router.\nTips for entering passwords\nPasswords are case sensitive \u2013 use the shift key  on the on-screen keyboard to enter a capital letter.\nSelect Show password or hide password on the password entry screen. This will allow you to view or hide your password as you enter it.\nHelp for your smart home device\nHow to find your wireless network name\n\nWhen setting up your Roku Smart Home camera or video doorbell, the Roku Smart Home mobile app generates a QR code to share the network details with your camera or doorbell. Because a 2.4GHz wireless network is required to make the connection, it is important to connect your phone or tablet to your 2.4GHz network before launching the app.\n\nYou may see two similar choices with your network name like MyNetwork_2.4GHz and MyNetwork_5GHz. Be sure to select the network that ends with \"2.4GHz\" or similar.\nYou may only see one choice with your network name. In this case, it is likely that your router is single-band and only supports a 2.4GHz network, or it is dual-band and routes traffic automatically to the proper channel. This network should work with your smart home devices.\nIf you cannot remember the name of your wireless network, go to the support site for your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. Also, sometimes the default name is listed on the bottom of the router.\nTips for entering passwords\nPasswords are case sensitive \u2013 make sure to type yours correctly.\nIf you have forgotten the password, go to the support site for your ISP or router manufacturer. They will be able to suggest the specific methods for their products to recover the password or reset it. Sometimes the default password is listed on the bottom of the router.\n\nIf you cannot get your Roku Smart Home devices connected, try resetting the Wi-Fi connection by having your phone or tablet \"forget the network\" in the settings menu. Once that is done, restart your mobile device and attempt setup again.\n\nLast updated on 11/2/2022,", "doc_id": "c4689b22-57fa-41a9-ae9b-86fd2ba7b26d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9bc5e61d25d21fceba5b227b400fbe2dde2b2b88130f0b20e9f5d402f9fb3b41", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4364}, "relationships": {"1": "94a30483-e757-4fdb-b093-9dd28449c402", "3": "489ea2ed-e61a-4328-877d-d042e720cfbb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "489ea2ed-e61a-4328-877d-d042e720cfbb": {"__data__": {"text": "cannot remember the name of your wireless network, go to the support site for your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer.

If you are not sure what type you have, you can check for a voice  button since only voice remotes have one.\n\nIf you have a Roku simple remote, be aware that it sends commands using infrared (IR) light and must be pointed directly at your player when pressing buttons. To begin using it, simply slide open the battery cover and insert fresh, matching batteries. Help is available if you have issues using your Roku simple remote.\n\nIf you have a Roku voice remote, it sends commands over a direct wireless connection that your Roku player creates using a discovery process called pairing. To assist with this process, you must put your voice remote into \"pairing mode\" using the method below that matches the type of battery in your remote.\n\nRechargeable battery: Some voice remotes, such as the Roku Voice Remote Pro have a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. To get this type of remote into pairing mode, press and hold the pairing button for 5 seconds until the status light turns green and starts flashing.\n\nStandard batteries: Other voice remotes use standard alkaline batteries just like a Roku simple remote. If your remote has batteries pre-installed and a battery pull-tab, pull the tab to power on the remote. If your remote does not come with batteries pre-installed, slide open the battery cover and insert fresh, matching batteries. Your remote will enter pairing mode once it receives power.\u00a0\n\nOnce your voice remote is in pairing mode, your Roku player will complete the pairing process automatically.

It may also be pre-installed on some Roku\u00ae streaming devices. Roku Media Player allows you to watch your own personal video files, listen to your music files, and view your photos using the Roku device\u2019s USB port (if available) or by accessing a media server on your local network.\n\nPlaying content stored on a USB drive\n\nSome Roku devices include a USB port to which you can connect an external USB drive for the purpose of playing locally stored photo, audio, and video files. You can connect more than one USB drive to your Roku device by connecting them to a USB hub.\n\nYou can use the Roku device comparison chart to determine which current products include a USB port.\n\nUSB drives may be formatted with different file systems. Roku Media Player supports drives that are formatted with the FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, EXT2, EXT3, and HFS+ file systems. You can also access different partitions on the USB drive.\n\nInsert the USB device into the USB port on your Roku device. If Roku Media Player is not installed, you will be prompted to add it from the Roku Channel Store. If the channel is installed, an on-screen prompt will ask you to launch Roku Media Player.\n\nNote: You can change how your Roku device behaves when a USB device is inserted by visiting Settings > System > USB media.\n\nIf you are in Roku Media Player when the USB device is inserted, a USB Drive icon should show up in the media device selection screen.\n\nYou can access this screen by selecting All from the main screen. If you do not see the icon, learn what to do if Roku Media Player does not detect the USB device.\n\nSearching for content on your USB drive\n\nBefore you can search your USB drive, Roku Media Player must first build a database of your content.

When the scan finishes, results are stored in the memory of your Roku device. If your Roku device has a micro SD slot, and a micro SD card is installed when a scan completes, results will also be saved there making them available each time you start Roku Media Player with the same USB drive.\n\nNote: Currently, only genre, artist, album, and song are extracted from audio files during a scan. You can, however, search by filename for any file.\n\nAfter Roku Media Player finishes building the database, you can perform a media search using the steps below.\n\nSelect the icon for your USB drive\nPress Star  on your Roku remote\nSelect Search to access the Search screen\nBegin entering the first few letters of your search and available results will begin to appear.

They must have the same name as the video and the .srt or .vtt extension. To include multiple files you must insert a language extension, for example movie.eng.srt or movie.ger.srt.\n\nSupport for playlists\n\nRoku Media Player supports .pls, .m3u and .m3u8 playlists on a USB drive. The media in the playlist should have an extension that indicates the media type, for example .mp3, .mkv, .jpg, etc. Playlist entries can also point to a URL. Make sure the URL begins with http:// and the extension should indicate the media type. If the playlist entry does not have a recognizable extension, it will be treated as a video and will try to detect the actual media type when it starts playing. Some DLNA servers will convert playlist files to folders that the Roku Media Player can access using DLNA.\n\nCreating USB drive that will auto start a slideshow, music playback, or a movie\n\nCreate a playlist file called Autostart.m3u in the root of the USB device. Put entries in that file that point to the media you want automatically played on your Roku.

If you have the Roku player connected to an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar, then first disconnect it and connect directly to the TV. This will remove any issue with the AVR or soundbar and make it easier to troubleshoot the problem.\n\nFirst, make sure the TV is turned on and press a button on the Roku remote control to ensure that the Roku device is not in standby or screensaver mode.\n\nThese are the most common reasons you may not see the picture on your TV:\n\nYou have the wrong input (source) selected on your TV\nThis is extremely common and an easy mistake to make. Most TV\u2019s have several video inputs on the back or side of the TV that are used for connecting different devices such as a cable box, gaming console, and of course, Roku player. You must select the input (sometimes referred to as source) that matches the one to which you have the Roku player connected.\nLook to see which input you have the Roku player connected; the video connector will be labelled with the input name; e.g. HDMI 1, HDMI 2, AUX, VIDEO IN 1, etc.\nThe way you change inputs can be different based on the brand of TV and model, but it is usually accessible from a button on the TV's remote control. If you can, check the instructions that came with your television, or try the following:\nLook for a button on your TV remote control that says Input, Source, AUX, Video, TV/Video or something similar. Press this button. Depending on your TV, pressing the button may cycle through available inputs, or it may display a menu with a choice of inputs.\nIf it cycles through the inputs - wait 10 seconds between button presses to allow the TV to detect the video.\nIf a menu is displayed - use the arrow buttons on the TV remote to choose the right input and then press the Enter or Select Alternatively, select each input one at a time. Wait 10 seconds between each to allow the TV to detect the video.\nIn both cases, if no video is detected on the input, then the TV will usual show a message such as \u201cNo video\u201d or \u201cNo signal detected\u201d.\nThe video cable is not connected properly or the cable is faulty\nCheck that the video cable is firmly connected to the back of your Roku player and to the HDMI or composite connector on the TV.

Your Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TV\u2122 is designed to play each title at the highest possible quality given the type of content, the speed of your internet connection, and capabilities of your TV.\n\nIn some cases, a playback issue may be the result of a network problem, or it may be caused by an outage with a single channel. This article will help if you experience any of the following issues while using your Roku device:\n\nUnable to play a specific title\nUnable to play any titles from a single channel\nUnable to play titles from any channel\nFrequent rebuffering (starting and stopping)\nPoor video quality or video is slow to start\nNote: If you see a purple screen or an HDCP error message, learn how to resolve issues when proper content protection technology is not detected.\nHow to identify and resolve a playback issue\n\nThe next several sections contain a variety of suggestions to help you identify the type of problem and resolve a playback issue. If you are instructed to restart your router* or Roku device, refer to the following instructions.\n\nRestart your router\n\nTo restart your router properly, you may need to review instructions from your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. In some cases, you can simply unplug your router and plug it back in, and in other cases it may require pressing a reset button on the device. For help, visit the website for your ISP or router manufacturer, or contact them directly.\n\nRestart your Roku device\n\nTo restart your Roku device, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it. Or you can use the following steps to restart it from the Settings menu.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\nUnable to play a specific title\n\nIf you discover that a specific movie or TV show does not play, try playing other titles from the same streaming channel. If you find other titles within the channel also fail to play correctly, yet some videos (still from the same channel) play without issue, visit the channel provider's website, or contact their customer support team to inquire about a service interruption or a possible outage.\n\nUnable to play any titles from a single channel\n\nIf you find that all titles from a single streaming channel fail to play correctly, try exiting that channel and play content from a different channel. For example, try playing a few titles from The Roku Channel. If you encounter playback issues with titles from the other channel, your problem is not isolated to a single channel, and you can move to the network troubleshooting suggestions later in this article.\n\nIf the channel requires a subscription, such as Netflix or Hulu Plus, make sure you have properly signed in or linked the channel to that subscription account. In some cases, you may need to link a channel using your credentials from your cable or satellite account. Follow the on-screen instructions or contact customer support for the channel provider if you need help signing in.\n\nIn some cases, removing the channel and then re-installing it may help. To ensure the process is successful, follow the steps below making sure you restart your Roku device before adding the channel again.\n\nRemove the channel: Highlight the channel tile on your home screen and press Star  to open the Options menu.

Before you begin troubleshooting, first determine which type of handheld remote you use with your Roku streaming device: A Roku simple remote or a Roku voice remote. A Roku remote with a voice button that has a microphone icon, or a magnifying glass icon is a Roku voice remote. A remote that does not have a voice button is a Roku simple remote.\n\nIf you have a Roku Touch\u2122 Tabletop Remote, see the tabletop remote troubleshooting guide instead.\n\nIf you need additional help figuring out which remote you have, review our guidelines for determining the type of Roku remote.\n\nHow the Roku simple and Roku voice remotes work\nHow does my Roku simple remote work?\n\nYour Roku simple remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to transmit button presses a short distance. For your simple remote to operate reliably, it must be pointed directly at your Roku streaming device and there must be nothing blocking the signal from travelling to the front of that device, where the IR receiver is located.\n\nTo set up a simple remote, you only need to insert new matching batteries and point the remote directly at the front of your streaming device when you are using it.\n\nHow does my Roku voice remote work?\n\nYour Roku voice remote communicates with your Roku streaming device over a dedicated wireless connection. Unlike a simple remote, you do not need to point your voice remote directly at your streaming device when pressing buttons. This allows you to install your streaming device behind a wall-mounted TV or another nearby, out-of-sight location.\n\nWhen setting up your voice remote, your streaming device uses a discovery process called pairing to detect a new remote and create the direct wireless connection. If your voice remote came in the box with your Roku device, you likely completed the pairing process during the initial setup and activation. If you upgraded to a voice remote after your Roku device was set up, you likely completed the pairing process from the Settings menu. Learn more about how to set up your Roku voice remote.\n\nTroubleshooting your Roku simple remote\n\nTo resolve issues with your Roku simple remote, start by looking for visible obstructions. The most common issue for a simple remote is missed button presses, which happen when your Roku streaming device is in a location where the remote signal is partially or fully blocked. Here are a few tips to ensure a clear path from your remote to your streaming device:\n\nAlways be sure you can see the front of your Roku device. When the device is powered on, you should see the status light on the front of the device.\n\n\nTest your remote from various positions. Try holding your remote higher (e.g., above your head) and point it downwards at the front of your Roku streaming device. Move the remote to the left and right, making sure it is always pointing directly at the front of your streaming device. If your streaming device becomes more responsive when testing from various positions, check that no obstructions are blocking the front of your device or the signal from your remote. If possible, move your streaming device to a position where it responds more reliably.\n\n.\n\n\nDo not hide your streaming player. If your streaming player is attached to your TV with the included adhesive strip, move it to a position where the signal is less likely to be blocked. Do not install it inside a closed cabinet or behind your TV.\n\nTroubleshooting your Roku voice remote\n\nIf your Roku voice remote is unresponsive, there are several troubleshooting steps you can take to attempt to solve any issues. Prior to taking any troubleshooting steps, it is important to know what type of battery your remote has, since troubleshooting steps will vary slightly. There are two varieties: Those that have a built-in rechargeable battery and those that use standard batteries.\n\nIf you are experiencing a different issue where your voice remote is not controlling power or volume on your TV, additional help is available", "doc_id": "623a2b26-5b8f-4922-be58-d17c4d72735c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1139a9112300c2a0dc44d8474df560d7ba01bcc2237522d41ad8223948f73fb2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4311}, "relationships": {"1": "1784e548-d97d-4b65-b233-e3ca1b89ba3f", "3": "01e8c7e0-26ff-4a9a-a699-c538f5db51c3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "01e8c7e0-26ff-4a9a-a699-c538f5db51c3": {"__data__": {"text": "not hide your streaming player.

If you are troubleshooting a Roku Streaming Stick, move it away from the HDMI connector on your TV by installing a free extension cable.\n\nTroubleshoot your remote batteries\n\nIf your remote uses standard batteries, slide open the battery cover, remove the batteries for a moment and then reinsert them. With a Roku simple remote, you can immediately try to control your streaming device. With a Roku voice remote, wait at least 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes a connection with your streaming device. To test for a successful connection, press the voice button and look for a status indicator on your TV screen. If the issue is not resolved, replace the batteries with a new matching pair and try again.\n\nIf your remote is rechargeable, press and hold the pairing button for 20 seconds. The status light should slowly flash green, stop, then flash rapidly. When this happens, release the pairing button and your remote has restarted. Wait at least 30 seconds to see if your remote establishes a connection with your streaming device. To test for a successful connection, press the voice button and look for a status indicator on your TV screen.\n\nReplace your Roku remote\n\nIf none of the previous steps solved the issue, you may need to replace your remote. You can buy a new Roku remote from the Roku accessories store. Make sure your streaming device is listed as a compatible device before making a purchase.\n\nAdvanced tips for your Roku voice remote\n\nIf you have a Roku voice remote and are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku streaming device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network.

If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network. If your router and streaming device both support 5GHz, enable the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network. Keep in mind that not all Roku streaming devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\n\nChange the wireless channel. When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually. To help you find un-congested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\n\nIf your streaming device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network. Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your streaming device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common.\n\nTo optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your streaming device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\nMove the router farther away. If your router is close to your streaming device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your streaming device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\nWarm or hot to touch\n\nIf the back of your Roku remote gets warm or hot during normal use, the rechargeable battery may be damaged or the alkaline batteries may be corroded.\n\nDiscontinue use of your remote.\nDisconnect your rechargeable remote from the charging cable.\nPlace remote on a hard non-flammable surface (like tile) and let it cool.

This search results screen is currently only available in the United States.\nWhat you need to use voice commands\n\nBefore you can take advantage of the latest enhancements to voice search and voice control, make sure your compatible Roku streaming device is running Roku OS 9.4 or higher, and you have one of the following control devices:\n\nRoku Voice Remote\nRoku Enhanced Voice Remote\nRoku Voice Remote Pro\nRoku Touch\u2122 tabletop remote\nRoku mobile app for iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122\n\nTo learn more about which streaming devices support voice, or to determine if your existing remote has voice capabilities, read about what you need to use voice commands with your streaming device.\n\nHow to issue a voice command\n\nThere are two types of voice commands supported on a Roku streaming device running Roku OS 10.0 or higher \u2013 push-to-talk voice and hands-free voice. Before you can use either type, you must first make sure your Roku voice remote is paired to your streaming device. Failing to pair your remote not only prevents advanced features like voice control from working, but it may also cause button presses to fail periodically.\n\nAny Roku voice remote supports push-to-talk voice, but only select models such as the Roku Voice Remote Pro support hands-free voice. For help identifying your remote, visit the detailed article that outlines the various types of Roku voice remotes.\n\nPush-to-talk voice instructions\n\nYour Roku voice remote has a voice button with either a microphone icon  (on newer remotes) or a magnifying glass icon  (on older remotes).\n\nTo issue a push-to-talk voice command, simply press and hold the voice button and say a command like \"search for comedies\", \"turn it up\", or \"launch The Roku Channel\". As soon as you release the button, your streaming device will carry out your request and deliver you to the Roku Search screen or elsewhere within the Roku interface.\n\nFor best results, try speaking in a conversational tone at normal volume. There is no reason to speak any slower or louder than normal, or overpronounce syllables or words.\n\nNote:\nWhen using a handheld remote, hold it 2 to 3 inches from your mouth when saying a voice command.\nWith a tabletop remote, you should be no more than 2 to 3 feet away.\nWith push-to-talk voice, your Roku voice remote is only \"listening\" when the button is being pressed. You must press and hold to successfully issue a voice command.\nHands-free voice instructions\n\nIn addition to push-to-talk voice, your Roku Voice Remote Pro supports hands-free voice which listens for your commands without the need for you to push a button or even handle your remote. To turn on hands-free voice, simply move the slider on the side of your remote to 'green'.\n\nWith hands-free voice turned on, try saying \"Hey Roku...\" with your remote nearby and add a command like \"pause\" or \"turn up the volume\". Practice other commands like \"Hey Roku, show me the news\", \"Hey Roku, turn captions on\", or \"Hey Roku, play classic rock\". Any command you can use with push-to-talk voice also works with hands-free voice.", "doc_id": "a6c710e5-a2e8-4465-9279-1dd4ae805bff", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bda7333fde40d9047545408e7232465d92e340602136980f7a406765b7a08c9a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4126}, "relationships": {"1": "a0418ef3-fa08-4443-9d9c-8b9d1a04f51c", "3": "7993a005-815f-4d35-86c7-a614dbec93a7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7993a005-815f-4d35-86c7-a614dbec93a7": {"__data__": {"text": "remote is only \"listening\" when the button is being pressed.

Any command you can use with push-to-talk voice also works with hands-free voice. Just remember to start with \"Hey Roku...\". You may find quick actions like \"Hey Roku, pause\" or \"Hey Roku, turn off the TV\" are more useful than some others. If you need to browse content or navigate a channel, for example, having your remote in hand may be easier.\n\nTip: When hands-free voice is turned on, you can say \u201cHey Roku, where\u2019s my remote?\u201d and your lost remote will play a sound so you can quickly find it.\n\nFor the best hands-free experience, try using a conversational tone at normal volume. Do not speak slower or louder than normal and do not overpronounce syllables or words. Speak naturally with a clear and direct \"Hey Roku...\" and follow the additional guidelines below:\n\nSpeak in the direction of your remote, not your TV.\nKeep your remote nearer to you than it is to your television. Otherwise, your remote may not hear you over TV noise.\nTry keeping your remote close to you, within 10 to 12 feet at the most.\nUsing voice with the Roku mobile app\n\nThe Roku mobile app is a free application for iOS and Android devices that can be used with any Roku streaming player or Roku TV. Not only does it let you use your voice to speak commands, but you can also stream content direct from The Roku Channel, share personal photos and videos on your TV, listen to movies and shows privately on your headphones, discover new content to watch, and more, all from your smartphone. Learn how to install the Roku mobile app now.\n\nAfter you download and install the Roku mobile app, you can use voice commands by accessing the Remote screen or going directly to Search using the instructions below.\n\nRemote screen\nTap Remote  from the bottom navigation bar\nTap the Voice button  on the bottom of the screen\nSearch\nTap the Search box  from the top navigation bar\nTap the Voice icon  in the search box\n\nSpeak into your mobile device at a normal volume, and then tap the middle of the screen when finished speaking or simply wait a moment.\n\nNote: The first time you use voice, the Roku mobile app will ask to access the microphone. You must grant permission to use voice controls.\n\nAfter your query is processed, the mobile app will carry out your request, either presenting you with a list of search results on your mobile device or updating your Roku streaming device.\n\nUsing voice when the Roku TV screen is off\n\nWhen a feature called Fast TV Start is enabled you can listen to music, live radio, podcasts, and more on Pandora, TuneIn, or iHeartRadio when the screen on your Roku TV is off, or wake your TV using voice commands. If you have a compatible Roku device connected to your Roku TV, you can also stream audio via Bluetooth from a smartphone, tablet, or computer when the TV screen is off.\n\nWhat voice commands can I use?\n\nWith voice search you can look for movies, TV shows, actors, streaming apps, and more. With voice control you can perform tasks like launching a streaming channel, pausing, and resuming playback, and skipping or rewinding songs. For a comprehensive list of examples, read the detailed article about the voice commands you can use with your Roku streaming device.\n\nWhat to do if a voice command is not recognized\n\nIf your spoken phrase is not captured correctly, follow the on-screen prompts to try again.

For examples, check out the tutorial video about using hands-free voice commands.\n\nIf voice searches are not working to your satisfaction, remember that you can also use Roku Search with the on-screen keyboard.\n\nLast updated on 11/3/2022, 5:52:43\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "d72ab4a6-36d5-4528-bc8a-814220eaec18", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "080bc46624995dea5d09c6c20d45bec99cc87fa4d7721f583f8077664c795e09", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7404, "end": 9082}, "relationships": {"1": "a0418ef3-fa08-4443-9d9c-8b9d1a04f51c", "2": "7993a005-815f-4d35-86c7-a614dbec93a7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "96561cc2-6fa1-4947-a1d7-3587a9d93831": {"__data__": {"text": "How to move channels on your Roku\u00ae streaming device\n\nAfter you add a channel from the Roku Channel Store, a square tile with a channel icon is added to the grid of channel tiles that appears under Home on the main screen of your Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TV\u2122.

Like these smart devices, your Roku\u00ae streaming device also has an operating system that runs software applications, and although uncommon, it too can become unresponsive. Should you find your Roku device in a frozen state or perhaps it is \"stuck at the Roku logo\" on startup, this article helps to rule out an environmental issue before progressing to a system restart, a network reset, and if necessary, a factory reset.\n\nIf you are simply returning or reselling your Roku device, jump directly to the factory reset steps to clear personal information and get your device back to a state ready for initial setup. All instructions here are intended to help with the following devices:\n\nRoku TV\u2122\nRoku streaming player\nRoku Streaming Stick\u00ae\nRoku Streambar\u00ae, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar\n\nFor help with other Roku products visit the appropriate article below:\n\nRoku wireless audio device: If you plan to return or resell your Roku wireless speakers, Roku subwoofer, or Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, or need to get your device back to a state ready for initial setup for another reason, refer to the detailed article about factory resetting your Roku wireless audio device.\n\nRoku voice remote: If you are replacing a lost or broken remote and need help getting your new remote to pair successfully, visit the detailed article about setting up your Roku voice remote. If you need troubleshooting help, learn how to fix a Roku voice remote that is not working.\n\nRoku Smart Home device: If you plan to resell or return your Roku Smart Home camera, video doorbell, bulb, plug, or light strip, or you simply want to return settings to the default, check out the article for factory resetting your Roku Smart Home device.\n\nWhat to check first\n\nIf you discover your Roku device is frozen or unresponsive, it is important to determine if the behavior is intermittent or remains constant. Does video start and stop, or does the image remain completely frozen? Can you control your device sporadically, or not at all? If symptoms come and go, external elements such as the remote, the network, or an HDMI\u00ae cable may be contributing. Efforts should be made to eliminate these possibilities, especially if you continue to see the same intermittent behavior over time.\n\nReplace batteries: If at times you are unable to control your Roku device, try installing new matching batteries in the remote. This often-overlooked solution may keep your troubleshooting to a minimum.\nCheck network: If you are seeing intermittent playback issues where the image is jerky and pixelated, try streaming video on another smart device on your network (e.g., smartphone, laptop). If you see the behavior on the other device, check out some tips for improving the Wi-Fi\u00ae network connection in your home.\nInspect HDMI cable: HDMI cables carry large amounts of data delivering video and audio to other devices. If you notice the picture freezes sporadically or see other video irregularities, try testing with an alternate HDMI cable (at least temporarily). Using quality HDMI cables is important, particularly when setting up a 4K Ultra HD and HDR device with your Roku TV or when connecting your Roku player or Streambar with a 4K TV or an HDR TV.\n\nIf after observing the symptoms, you determine the behavior is constant, a reset method described in the next sections may be necessary. If you have a Roku TV, before you begin, check to see if it responds when using the physical buttons on the TV bezel. If these are not easily visible, feel for the buttons by moving your hand along the top, bottom, and side edges.\n\nSystem restart your device\n\nA system restart is the least invasive reset method. If you have a Roku TV, it is not the same as pressing the power button on the remote or the physical power button on the TV itself.

It will appear similar to one of the following:\n\nOnce you locate the Reset button and your Roku device is powered on, press and hold the button firmly for about 10 seconds. When the factory reset is complete, an indicator light or status LED will blink rapidly on most Roku devices.\n\nAfter a successful factory reset, your Roku device will restart in the same state as a factory-new device, and will be ready for you to complete the following:\n\nPerform the Guided Setup and activation process\nSign in to streaming channels that require a username and password\nCreate a 4-digit PIN and configure parental control settings\nPerform a broadcast television channel scan (if you have a Roku TV with an HDTV antenna connected)\nRecovery mode on a Roku TV\n\nIf you have a Roku TV, you can try using Recovery Mode to reinstall the operating system.

Typical scams aimed at Roku users falsely claim to be affiliated with the company in a malicious effort to get you to pay for services that Roku offers for free, such as Roku device activation and technical support. This article explains how these activation and technical support scams work, how you can protect yourself from them, and what to do if you have fallen victim to such a scam.\n\nHow scammers try to fool you\n\nScammers use misleading tactics and bogus websites to try and gain access to your sensitive personal and financial information. Their official looking sites may include Roku-branded images, flashy marketing pages, and instructional articles, all with the intent of convincing you that you are visiting an actual Roku website. Some attack right away, requesting your personal information with a friendly pop-up chat box, while others take a passive approach and let you find and enter an activation code on your own before getting you to take action when your code is rejected.\n\nSome fraudulent sites request an email address or phone number where they can contact you directly, while others present a \"support phone number\" and ask you to call them. When you do talk to someone posing as a \"support agent\", they can often be firm and forceful, and sometimes even rude and vulgar. Regardless of their methods and manners, the ultimate goal of a scammer is tricking you into giving out personal information and paying for services that Roku offers for free.\n\nHow you can end up on a phony website\n\nUnfortunately, criminals are intelligent and go to great lengths to get their websites to rank well on internet search engines like Google and Bing. Some even pay for an advertisement that appears at the top of the first page of search results. If you visited a phony website recently, you likely got there after browsing a list of internet search results and opening what appeared to be a reputable link. Search phrases such as \"roku com link\", \"roku link\", and \"roku activation\" are a few of the more common terms fraudulent sites try to rank for, but in general, any internet search for Roku support is vulnerable to attack. Always be vigilant and suspect a fraudulent site anytime you have doubt.\n\nHow to know if a website is fake\n\nWhen you are not sure whether a website you are visiting is legitimate or fake, look at the internet web address (or URL) located in the address bar at the top of your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.). All official Roku websites have a URL on a roku.com domain. You may see a longer address like support.roku.com, my.roku.com, community.roku.com, blog.roku.com, or channelstore.roku.com, but any official Roku website always ends with roku.com. If a website offers technical support for Roku but has a different domain (even if only slightly different) you should assume the website is fake and use it with extreme caution if you choose to use it at all.\n\nIf you examine a suspicious site more closely, you may find disclaimers that explicitly state they are an independent company not affiliated with Roku, do not charge for activation (often despite the contrary), and only offer Roku support services. They do this to try and protect themselves legally but be careful as they may still try and take your money for services that Roku offers for free.\n\nHow to protect yourself from a scam\n\nWith a variety of opportunistic and fraudulent sites out there today and new ones popping up often, it is important to understand the details of different types of scams and what you can do to protect yourself.\n\nScams requiring a fee to activate a Roku device: If a website reports that your activation code failed, do not call their \"support phone number\" for help. They are only looking to charge your credit card for activation which is not necessary. Remember, activating your Roku device is always free, and always has been (i.e., Roku has", "doc_id": "cf2c06c8-20e0-4566-b009-328f28a01372", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "238acd99b1a28d1a27b73895678448693e17dd75765a8ffafb0b627928586466", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4258}, "relationships": {"1": "ca231bf7-de85-464b-b0f2-b8008e8f18aa", "3": "d96f53d4-3613-4ebe-b018-cb24e3c3d28f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d96f53d4-3613-4ebe-b018-cb24e3c3d28f": {"__data__": {"text": "company not affiliated with Roku, do not charge for activation (often despite the contrary), and only offer Roku support services.

If you need help, review the steps required to complete the device activation process.\n\nScams charging to create a Roku account: If you speak on the phone with someone posing as a \"Roku support agent\" and they want to charge your credit card to create a Roku account or to register your player, hang up! There is never a charge to create a Roku account. When you set up and activate your Roku device, you are prompted to create your free account, or if you prefer, you can create your Roku account ahead of time by visiting roku.com/signup.\n\nScams asking for money to help with setup: There is no fee to set up your Roku device. The Roku support site contains a number of instructional videos and articles to assist you in setting up your Roku device(s) for free, and owners of eligible products can contact an official Roku support agent as well.\n\nScams selling service or support subscriptions: Do not pay for a monthly or annual subscription with the promise of help with wireless network issues, remote control problems, or other technical issues. You will likely never get to use your subscription as most scammers pack up and close shop before you get the assistance you need. For help with these types of technical issues, visit the Roku support site, or connect with other customers on the Roku Community.\n\nScams taking control of your Roku device: Beware of scammers who try and activate your Roku device using their own Roku account. If successful, they can disable your Roku device at any time and demand credit card payment for reactivation. Always activate your Roku device yourself using your own valid email address and a strong, secure password.\n\nScams seeking access to your computer: Do not grant remote access to your computer even if a scammer claims to be able to use it to activate your Roku device or resolve a technical issue. This tactic is often used to install malicious software and access it to steal your personal and financial information. Some scammers even ask you to pay for the software with a promise that it prevents viruses and helps your computer run faster.\n\nScams selling access to channel bundles or lifetime programming: Premium channels can be installed and subscribed to directly from your Roku device, and you can enter existing subscription details for other paid channels, but Roku does not sell lifetime subscriptions. Be aware if someone tries to sell you this service.\n\nBeyond understanding some of the more common scams out there, there are a number of general practices you should employ to best protect yourself.\n\nWhen you are trying to activate your Roku device or seeking technical assistance, make sure you are only visiting official Roku websites. As explained in the previous section, all official Roku websites end with roku.com. Sites that end in another domain (no matter how similar) are not affiliated with Roku and should be avoided.\nNever provide your social security number, date of birth, or Roku account password to anyone when trying to get help with your Roku device. Roku support agents will never ask for this information.\nDo not grant access to your computer, provide computer passwords, or agree to install third-party software when seeking help with your Roku device. You will never be asked by a Roku support agent to provide passwords or install software on your computer.\nWhat to do if you gave contact information to a scammer or paid for support\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of an activation or technical support scam from another company, please take the following actions:\n\nCheck your", "doc_id": "d96f53d4-3613-4ebe-b018-cb24e3c3d28f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "16a8756601993d8f64fe766c5e90693dc1b4bf0936808d6d4b14375d03778772", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3543, "end": 8016}, "relationships": {"1": "ca231bf7-de85-464b-b0f2-b8008e8f18aa", "2": "cf2c06c8-20e0-4566-b009-328f28a01372", "3": "da4a68ed-6599-4ef3-ab3f-6e079b6cc398"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "da4a68ed-6599-4ef3-ab3f-6e079b6cc398": {"__data__": {"text": "in the previous section, all official Roku websites end with roku.com.

While Roku does not have a tool for tracking lost or stolen devices, we do recommend taking the following precautions.\n\nRemove streaming device from Roku account and cancel subscriptions\n\nWhen you first discover your Roku streaming device is lost or stolen, immediately remove it from your Roku account. Your Roku account stores information about which Roku streaming devices you own, which channels you have installed, preferences, settings, and payment method. Removing the lost or stolen streaming device from your Roku account prevents unauthorized purchases.\n\nRemoving a streaming device does not close your Roku account, which means you\u2019ll still be charged for any active subscriptions on your account. If the lost or stolen streaming device is your only Roku device, you may want to turn off auto-renew and cancel your subscriptions.\n\nRemove streaming device from service provider accounts\n\nTo prevent unauthorized purchases, sign in to your service provider account (for example, Netflix, VUDU, Fandango) and remove the lost or stolen Roku streaming device. Contact the channel provider if you need help removing the device.\n\nRemoving a streaming device does not close your service provider account. If the lost or stolen streaming device is your only Roku device, you may want to consider cancelling your subscription. There is often a limit to the number of devices that can be associated with a provider account at one time. Once removed, the lost or stolen device will not count against that limit.\n\nKeep Roku Smart Home device on your Roku account\n\nIf your Roku Smart Home device is stolen, don't delete it from your Roku account. It can only be set up using your Roku account. So if anyone tries to set up your Roku Smart Home device using a different account, you'll get an email notification letting you know. To receive the notification, it needs to remain attached to your account.\u00a0\n\nAdditional steps to consider\nIf your Roku account credentials have been compromised, change your Roku account email address and/or password. If you use the same credentials to sign in to your service provider accounts, contact the provider and change your email address and/or password.\nIf your credit or debit card has been lost or stolen, change the payment method on your Roku account.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about unauthorized purchases via your Roku device, contact your financial institution and request a \u2018STOP\u2019 on your credit card.\nLast updated on 10/12/2022, 4:00:01\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "85290332-19fc-4971-b45f-9320f6584019", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7ade570e761e928609b71bcab24da3c596e39712006dc1ce16eda899c53368bf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2774}, "relationships": {"1": "6032fc0d-2e5d-4279-83ba-ac742e886a0b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2a5c5e4-46d2-40bb-8155-cd3fc16683d7": {"__data__": {"text": "Roku devices limited warranty and End User License Agreement\nLimited warranty\n\nFor any Roku\u00ae Smart Home device, Roku streaming player, Roku Streaming Stick\u00ae, or Roku audio device, Roku warrants the hardware against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase (\"Warranty Period\") if used in accordance with the provided documentation.

If the results from a connection check display poor or fair signal strength, or you experience connection or playback issues regardless of the results, try the suggestions below to help improve your wireless connection.\n\nEliminate wireless interference: Cordless phones, microwave ovens, or other wireless devices near your router can cause wireless interference that may effect the quality of your network connection. Move any such device away from your wireless router.\n\nCheck with your ISP: Visit the website of your internet service provider, or ISP (usually your cable or phone company), or contact them directly to inquire about any outages or connectivity-related issues. You should also confirm that your internet package provides speeds fast enough for streaming.\n\nReduce network usage by other devices: Devices currently accessing the network, such as other streaming players, computers, game consoles, and mobile devices may effect the quality of your network connection. Temporarily stop using any such device and check if that makes a difference. You may need to reduce usage of other network devices when using your Roku device.\n\nMove your Roku device or Router:\n\nReduce distance: Moving your Roku device and router closer to each other will strengthen the wireless signal. If this is not an ideal long-term solution, at least try moving the devices closer temporarily to verify the signal strength is the problem. Sometimes moving each device even a short distance may make a difference.\nEliminate obstructions: Install both devices where there are fewer objects and walls between them. If your router or Roku device is inside a cabinet, we recommend taking it out. Reducing the number of obstructions will improve the signal strength.\nAdjust router antennas: If your router has one or more external antennas, try re-orienting the antennas and check the signal strength.\nTry an elevated location: Try moving your router and/or", "doc_id": "1c5ae641-f333-438b-ae27-826a1543b35a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "940f1f42ad92b9418f26c4c736dc7d16018f4269133346332609f76e25036b32", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4348}, "relationships": {"1": "5f537629-b515-4973-9312-480cdb2af270", "3": "7b63d2ab-d72e-477b-93cd-c86733849113"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b63d2ab-d72e-477b-93cd-c86733849113": {"__data__": {"text": "your Roku device or Router:\n\nReduce distance: Moving your Roku device and router closer to each other will strengthen the wireless signal.

If you are using a Roku\u00ae Streaming Stick\u00ae, try moving it away from your TV by installing the free HDMI extender cable.\nNote: The Roku Streaming Stick+ connects to the network via advanced wireless receiver. Using an HDMI extender will not improve the wireless signal strength.\nTry another TV: If you have a Roku player, move it to a different TV that is closer to your wireless router to confirm the wireless signal strength is the problem.\nAdditional options\n\nIf the wireless signal is still not strong enough after trying the suggestions above, here are some additional options:\n\nPurchase a new router: A new wireless router may provide a stronger signal, or may have more reliable software. Routers do vary considerably in their quality \u2013 so read the online reviews.\nAdvanced home network options: There are more advanced home network options, such as range extenders, \u201cmesh network\u201d routers, or powerline extenders which can increase wireless coverage within your house. You can also try out the \"Pro tips\" listed at the end of the article.\nUse Ethernet: If you have a Roku device with an Ethernet jack, you may be able to connect an Ethernet cable. Or Ethernet may be a temporary solution to verify that the wireless connection is your real problem.\nTry another TV: If you have a Roku player, move it to a different TV that is closer to your wireless router to confirm the wireless signal strength is the problem.\n\nIf these steps haven't resolved your issue, you can return your Roku device for a refund (if within the return window of your retailer).\n\nPro tips\n\nIf you are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network: If your router and Roku device both support 5GHz, make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network.\n\nNote: Not all Roku devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\nChange the wireless channel: When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download", "doc_id": "7b63d2ab-d72e-477b-93cd-c86733849113", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3f129f4dd5b24e0fe105dc9d822d7fd9364114bbf818bdec1a4742a4cff1fe57", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3679, "end": 7829}, "relationships": {"1": "5f537629-b515-4973-9312-480cdb2af270", "2": "1c5ae641-f333-438b-ae27-826a1543b35a", "3": "4b45a6d1-a8ef-4ffc-b759-518597d1d588"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b45a6d1-a8ef-4ffc-b759-518597d1d588": {"__data__": {"text": "make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz).

Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\n\nIf your Roku device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network: Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your Roku device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common. Additionally, if your 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless networks have different network names, your Roku device will only be able to connect to the 2.4GHz wireless network.\n\nTo optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your Roku device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\n\nMove the router farther away: If your router is close to your Roku device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your Roku device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n*A note on terminology:\n\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.\n\nLast updated on 3/15/2023, 5:49:42\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "4b45a6d1-a8ef-4ffc-b759-518597d1d588", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c95e80bccaf6071e96970c6281b4ddabcbe2f346237a7d617fd86584ea10a532", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7679, "end": 11076}, "relationships": {"1": "5f537629-b515-4973-9312-480cdb2af270", "2": "7b63d2ab-d72e-477b-93cd-c86733849113"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2e1488f-943c-4391-85b0-298cf73ead0a": {"__data__": {"text": "How to use Hotel and Dorm Connect to connect to the internet\n\nWhen you are away from home, Hotel and Dorm Connect allows you to stream your favorite movies and TV shows using the internet connection at a hotel or college dorm.

You can typically find instructions how to do this along with the latest software on the TV manufacturer\u2019s website.

Roku Voice is available on compatible Roku voice remotes, as well as the free Roku mobile app.\n\nTo help Roku users get the most out of Roku Voice, Roku OS 9.4 introduces helpful hints that will appear directly on the user's TV screen to inform them of voice commands they can use on their Roku device. These hints are designed to help users enjoy quick, simple control of their Roku device using a wide variety of voice commands. To ensure the hints are as relevant to users as possible, some hints are designed to appear when users are taking a specific action. For example, if a user is in the Closed Captions menu within Settings, they may see a hint letting them know they can use Roku Voice to quickly turn Closed Captions on/off.\n\nPerformance improvements \u2013 With each software update, Roku strives to deliver improved performance to ensure users can enjoy the best, smoothest streaming experience possible with minimal buffering, quick video start times, great video quality, and more. Roku OS 9.4 continues these efforts by introducing a variety of performance improvements. This includes faster initial setup, so users will spend less time waiting for channels to install when setting up their Roku devices. This is especially convenient for existing users who are adding more Roku devices in their home to speed up the activation process. Additionally, users will notice improvements in launch times for top channels, faster video start times, and more.\n\nUpdate to Theme Packs (U.S. only) \u2013 First introduced in Roku OS 9.3, Theme Packs allow users to customize their home screen and screen saver with a variety of fun themes such as Jungle, Western, Nautical, Kids, and more. Roku OS 9.4 makes these themes even more enjoyable by adding corresponding audio tones when users press various buttons on their Roku remote. For example, users who've chosen the Jungle Theme Pack will hear the roar of a lion when pressing a button, while users who have selected the Western Theme Pack will hear the jingling of spurs. Users can mix and match the various elements of Theme Packs to customize their experience with different home screen wallpapers, screen savers, and audio tones. In addition, users can easily turn the audio tones on/off in the Settings menu.\n\nRoku audio - Surround level control for multi-channel audio (U.S. only) \u2013 Users of Roku audio products who have a multi-channel speaker configuration, for example a Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku TV Wireless Speakers, can now adjust the volume of their rear surround speakers relative to the volume of their soundbar. This setting allows users to tailor the overall balance of sound in their room to their personal preference. If a user has a multi-channel Roku audio configuration, they can access this new setting by pressing the Star button  on their remote to access the Sound settings menu, or by accessing the Audio menu within Settings on their device.\n\nSupported Roku devices receiving Roku OS 9.4:\n\nRoku Streaming Players \u2013 9102X, 9101X, 4800X, 4670X, 4662X, 4661X, 4660X, 4640X, 4630X, 4620X, 4400X, 4230X, 4210X, 4200X, 3931X, 3930X, 3921X, 3920X, 3910X, 3900X, 3811X, 3810X, 3800X, 3710X, 3700X, 3600X, 3500X, 2720X, 2710X, 2700X\nRoku TV", "doc_id": "3f9130f5-cb9c-468f-a09e-ba1f7e60f2d4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0db146d49716ced0b1c68e19133b5ee7fe037dc4b00d8c90f53c6b0b948db09c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 56677, "end": 60651}, "relationships": {"1": "3159b7e3-2ab9-4610-9c99-6eefa46b8554", "2": "f4ad05e5-3fc2-4ead-963e-eaf196aee5d0", "3": "1e6e83a5-a797-40dd-8a7d-6a705ef27399"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e6e83a5-a797-40dd-8a7d-6a705ef27399": {"__data__": {"text": "preference.

Highlights of Roku OS 9.3 include support for Spanish language commands when using Roku Voice, Works with Alexa and Works with Google Assistant support in additional countries, new ways to personalize the Roku Home Screen and more.\n\nRoku OS 9.3 is available on select Roku players starting today and is expected to roll out to all supported streaming players in the coming weeks. Roku TV\u2122 models are expected to receive the automatic software update this summer. A list of key features and updates, as well as supported Roku devices, is included below.\n\nKey Roku OS 9.3 features:\n\nUpdates to Roku Voice \u2013 Roku Voice makes it easy for users to find their favorite entertainment and control their Roku streaming experience with a variety of simple voice commands. It's been developed with a specific focus on entertainment and adding ease and convenience to users' interactions with features and functionality of the Roku platform. Roku OS 9.3 continues the evolution of Roku Voice and its capabilities with a number of new features:\n\nSpanish Language Support (U.S. and Mexico) \u2013 Roku Voice is available to Roku users in Mexico for the first time with the addition of Spanish language voice commands. Users in the U.S. can also choose to speak their commands in Spanish when using Roku Voice. To enable this feature, users must set the language on their Roku device to Spanish from within the Settings menu. Once the Roku device\u2019s language is set to Spanish, users simply press and hold the microphone button on their Roku remote (if compatible) or tap the icon from within the free Roku mobile app to speak the full range of supported Roku Voice commands. Roku Voice allows users to quickly find their favorite entertainment by searching for titles, actors, or genres, as well as control media playback on their Roku device, launch channels and more.\n\nNote: If a user has their Roku device\u2019s language set to Spanish, they must speak commands in Spanish when using Roku Voice within the Roku mobile app, even if their mobile device is set to another language.\n\nVisual Search Results for Roku Voice (U.S. only) \u2013 When using Roku Voice to search for movies, shows or popular genres, users will now see a more visual, easy to browse display of movie and TV show artwork rather than a text-based list of options. This new search results screen orders the results in categorized rows that include relevant movies, shows, short-form content and more for simple navigation and quick discovery of entertainment. Once a user selects the specific movie or show they want to watch, they'll see an unbiased list of channels that offer that title, ordered by price (including free when available), so they can choose the viewing option that's best for them.\n\nUpdates to Roku Voice in International Regions \u2013 Roku OS 9.3 introduces updates to Roku Voice in Canada, Ireland", "doc_id": "1e6e83a5-a797-40dd-8a7d-6a705ef27399", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2614214a15fd5223e33fa39be9ec30bf95122f5e51fde08870675511cb5c0795", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 60895, "end": 64852}, "relationships": {"1": "3159b7e3-2ab9-4610-9c99-6eefa46b8554", "2": "3f9130f5-cb9c-468f-a09e-ba1f7e60f2d4", "3": "ac32dd8a-4bd3-4a7d-845e-7ebf25445d3d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac32dd8a-4bd3-4a7d-845e-7ebf25445d3d": {"__data__": {"text": "even if their mobile device is set to another language.\n\nVisual Search Results for Roku Voice (U.S. only) \u2013 When using Roku Voice to search for movies, shows or popular genres, users will now see a more visual, easy to browse display of movie and TV show artwork rather than a text-based list of options.

It also introduces a greater variety of supported voice commands for media playback such as \"fast forward\" or \"pause,\" and device control such as \"turn on closed captions.\"\nSupport for News Related Commands (U.S. only) \u2013 Roku Voice users can now say \u201cshow me the news\u201d and be directed to a Roku Zone filled with a variety of available news channels, or \"play the news\" to jump right into a live stream of ABC News within The Roku Channel. If a user says \u201cplay the news on [CHANNEL],\" they will be directed to that specific news channel and this preference will be remembered so that any future command of \u201cplay the news\u201d will launch their preferred news channel for a more personalized experience.\nNew Voice Help and Tips \u2013 To help users learn more about the capabilities of Roku Voice, Roku OS 9.3 introduces the ability for users to quickly tap the microphone button on the Roku remote (if compatible) and be presented with on-screen tips for a variety of commands they can try when using Roku Voice.\nMore Channels for Direct Playback \u2013 In the U.S., more than 50 top channels now support the direct playback feature of Roku Voice. Initially launched as part of Roku OS 9.1, direct playback helps customers get to entertainment more quickly when using Roku Voice to search for entertainment by directly playing the show or movie when possible, rather than displaying a search results screen. Playback will occur in most instances when the movie or show is available on one of the 50+ supported channels if the user has the channel installed, as well as when users specifically indicate the channel name in their voice command. If direct playback from a voice command is not available for a movie or show, users will continue to see unbiased search results ordered by price so they can choose the best viewing option for their needs.\n\nMore information on Roku Voice and supported commands is available on the Roku support site.\n\nWorks with Alexa and Works with Google Assistant in More Countries \u2013 Roku users in Canada, Mexico and the U.K. can control their Roku players and Roku TVs by speaking commands to Alexa-enabled and/or Google Assistant-enabled devices they already have in their homes. Users simply need to find and link the Roku Alexa skill and/or Google Assistant action in their respective mobile apps in order to control their Roku devices by speaking commands such as, \u201cAlexa, launch [CHANNEL] on Roku,\u201d or \u201cOK Google, pause on living room Roku.\u201d Roku TV owners can also say things like \u201cAlexa, turn off Roku\u201d or \"hey Google, switch to HDMI 2 on living room Roku.\"\n\nVisit the Roku support site for more information on Roku\u2019s Alexa skill and Google Assistant action.\n\nMore Home Screen Personalization Options \u2013 Roku OS 9.3 makes it easier for users to give their Home Screen a personal touch. A variety of Home Screen wallpapers, as well as screensavers, are now accessible from a single \u201cTheme\u201d menu item located within Settings. When users select \u201cTheme\u201d from the menu, they will see a selection of available options to change the appearance of their device's Home Screen wallpaper and/or screensaver.\n\nUsers in the U.S. can", "doc_id": "ac32dd8a-4bd3-4a7d-845e-7ebf25445d3d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2f59fdc32ee2f7b9dd6a9cf7e466b440236be69481af206e105278be784782a0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 64593, "end": 68824}, "relationships": {"1": "3159b7e3-2ab9-4610-9c99-6eefa46b8554", "2": "1e6e83a5-a797-40dd-8a7d-6a705ef27399", "3": "3d03f5bb-610b-4fad-bc83-729da33fe304"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d03f5bb-610b-4fad-bc83-729da33fe304": {"__data__": {"text": "on Roku,\u201d or \u201cOK Google, pause on living room Roku.\u201d Roku TV owners can also say things like \u201cAlexa, turn off Roku\u201d or \"hey Google, switch to HDMI 2 on living room Roku.\"\n\nVisit the Roku support site for more information on Roku\u2019s Alexa skill and Google Assistant action.\n\nMore Home Screen Personalization Options \u2013 Roku OS 9.3 makes it easier for users to give their Home Screen a personal touch. A variety of Home Screen wallpapers, as well as screensavers, are now accessible from a single \u201cTheme\u201d menu item located within Settings. When users select \u201cTheme\u201d from the menu, they will see a selection of available options to change the appearance of their device's Home Screen wallpaper and/or screensaver.\n\nUsers in the U.S. can select the available wallpapers and screensavers from a more visual, browsable view with categories such as Featured, Most Popular and more. They also have access to Theme packs, a new way for users to customize their experience, that include a matching Home Screen wallpaper and screensaver. Theme packs available at launch include Jungle, Western, Movie Magic and more. For even greater customization options, users can mix and match Home Screen wallpapers and screensavers.\n\nRoku users in all regions also have greater control over the tiles that appear in the Shortcut section of their Home Screen. Shortcut tiles can be hidden or moved to another position within the Shortcut section by pressing the \u201c*\u201d key on the Roku remote and selecting the \u201cHide shortcut\u201d or \"Move shortcut\" option. If a user chooses to hide all Shortcut tiles, the entire Shortcut section will be hidden from the Home Screen. To add/unhide Shortcut tiles, users can go to Settings > Home Screen > Shortcuts and select the specific Shortcut tiles they want to appear on their Home Screen.\n\nNote: Both the \u201cThemes\u201d and \u201cScreensavers\u201d categories have been removed from the Roku Channel Store. Users now have a single method to add/change their Home Screen wallpapers and screensavers by going to Settings > Theme.\n\nPerformance Improvements \u2013 A variety of updates have been made in Roku OS 9.3 to improve performance across supported Roku devices. After the Roku device receives the software update, users will experience a reduction in device boot times, faster launch times for a select number of channels (with more supported channels coming soon), a more responsive Home Screen and faster navigation when using features such as Featured Free. Roku users with older Roku TV models and streaming players will likely see the greatest improvements to their device's performance with this update.\n\nA New Interface for Roku Media Player \u2013 The Roku Media Player channel\u2019s interface has been updated with a new design that aligns more closely with the broader Roku user interface, including larger visuals and a new display when playing music files for viewing track information and album artwork (if available). The redesigned Roku Media Player channel makes it simple for users to find and play media files, including video, music and photos, when using their Roku device\u2019s USB port (if available) or by accessing a media server on their local network.\n\nEnhanced experience when using a Roku Smart Soundbar on a Roku TV \u2013 Roku TV users who've connected a Roku Smart Soundbar to their TV can now access more of their soundbar settings directly from the Roku TV interface, eliminating the need to switch back and forth between menus or use multiple remotes. With Roku OS 9.3, users can pair an external device such as a mobile phone to the Roku Smart Soundbar for Bluetooth\u00ae audio playback by simply accessing the TV's Settings menu. In addition, the TV\u2019s Settings menu can be used to pair other Roku audio products to the soundbar, such as the Roku Wireless Subwoofer and Roku TV Wireless Speakers for full surround sound. These updates build upon a previous software release that automated setup of the Roku Smart Soundbar when connected to a Roku TV and made the soundbar\u2019s sound settings accessible via the TV\u2019s interface.\n\nAdditionally, the input tile for the Roku Smart Soundbar can now be hidden/unhidden from the user\u2019s Roku TV Home Screen based on their streaming preference.

Changes include a new navigation bar that remains in place at the top of the mobile screen when users are connected to a Roku device. This persistent navigation bar provides users with quick access to Roku Search, a dropdown menu of available devices so users can easily switch the device they want to control with their mobile app, and a shortcut to the remote screen.\n\nThe remote screen of the Roku mobile app has also been redesigned to include quick access icons so users can launch useful mobile app features without the need to exit the remote screen. For example, a quick access icon has been added that allows users to browse and launch their recently viewed channels directly from the remote screen. Users will also notice that the main navigation tabs at the bottom of the mobile app screen have been simplified to include icons for watching The Roku Channel on their mobile device, viewing their Roku device information, and access to their mobile app settings.\n\nIn addition, the search experience within the Roku Mobile App in the U.S. has been enhanced with the inclusion of genre-based Roku Zones on the search screen. When users visit the search screen, they can now browse a variety of Zones such as Action, Comedy, News and more within the app to quickly find a movie or show to watch. Once they tap on a specific Zone, they'll see a browsable selection of relevant movies and shows, organized into categories including new releases, free and more.

If you have a Roku TV\u2122 system, then you can also use a USB drive to pause live television.\n\nThis article will help you determine why your Roku device cannot detect your USB drive.\n\nUSB drive filesystem format is not supported\n\nUSB drives can be formatted with different file systems. Roku devices support USB drives that are formatted with the FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, EXT2, EXT3, and HFS+ file systems. Many new USB drives are pre-formatted with the exFAT file system, which is not supported.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know which file system is used, insert the USB drive into an available USB port on your computer. When the drive appears on the desktop, right click on the icon with your mouse and select Properties on your PC, or Get info on your Mac.\n\nNote: If you are using the USB drive to pause live television on a Roku TV system, then the filesystem format does not matter as you will be prompted to reformat the drive.\nUSB drive may not have sufficient power\n\nThere are many types of USB drives, from large external hard drives to smaller thumb drives. It is important to note that different drives have different power requirements \u2013 for example, some USB hard drives have an external power adapter that must be connected to a power outlet.\n\nThe most common reason the Roku device may fail to detect the USB drive is that USB drive requires more power than the Roku device can provide.\n\nYou may also see the message \"This USB device requires more power.

This includes your TV, an audio/video receiver (AVR), and any other devices connected in between. If even one device does not support HDCP 2.2, then the 4K or HDR movie or TV show can only be viewed in a lower resolution, such as 720p or 1080p.\n\nNote: Only select Roku players support 4K or HDR. Learn about the other requirements for streaming 4K or requirements for streaming HDR.\n\nWhat is HDCP 2.2?\n\nThe latest copy protection technology is called\u00a0HDCP\u00a0(High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) and\u00a0is\u00a0used on HDMI connections for digital devices like Blu-ray\u2122 players, cable boxes and Roku streaming devices. HDCP is\u00a0the copy and content protection standard used by the movie and TV industry. Copy protection/content protection has been around for a long time, and in its early stages was what prevented you from copying commercial VHS tapes. HDCP 2.2 is specifically designed for 4K Ultra HD content, as well as movies and TV shows available with High Dynamic Range.\n\nWhat happens if HDCP 2.2 support is not detected?\n\nIf your Roku player does not detect support for HDCP 2.2, you may see the following message during setup:\n\n\u2026or you may see the message below when trying to change to one of the 4K or HDR selections in Settings > Display type:\n\n...or you may see the following \"HDCP Error Detected\" message when attempting to play 4K or HDR content.\n\nHow do I avoid this?\n\nReview the following items to make sure your Roku streaming player is set up for HDCP 2.2.\n\nUse Premium High Speed HDMI Cables.\u00a0Be sure to use Premium High Speed HDMI Cables for each link in the chain. Using a subpar cable for even one link may cause an HDCP 2.2 failure.\nYour TV must have an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2.\u00a0Verify that your TV has at least one HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2. Not all 4K TVs support HDCP 2.2, including early models and some lesser-known brands.\nYour AVR must have an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2.\u00a0If you are connecting your Roku player through an AVR, the AVR must also support HDCP 2.2. In fact, every device in the chain between the Roku player and the TV must also support HDCP 2.2. Check the documentation for your AVR to make sure that HDCP 2.2 is supported on the HDMI input you are using.\n\nIf you have a 4K-compatible TV or an HDR-compatible TV but your AVR does not support HDCP 2.2, you can still get 4K or HDR video and use your AVR. You just need two connections. Connect your Roku player directly to an HDCP 2.2 input on your TV, and use either ARC (Audio Return Channel) or S/PDIF (if available) to route the audio from the TV back to the AVR.\n\n\nTip: If you are using an AVR and want to determine if it is the source of the issue, try removing it from the chain and connect your Roku player directly to an HDCP 2.2 input on your TV. If HDCP 2.2 support is detected in this configuration, there is an issue with the AVR connection. Try a different HDMI cable and input on the AVR if possible.\nHow do I determine which HDMI inputs support HDCP 2.2?\n\nIf your name-brand 4K TV, HDR TV, or AVR was purchased in the past couple of years, there is a good chance it has at least one HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2. When determining which inputs support HDCP 2.2, start with the obvious \u2013 look for the inputs labeled with \u201cHDCP 2.2\u201d.\n\nNote: On some TVs, the HDMI inputs are part of an external box that is attached to the display via special cable.

Connect your Roku player to the labeled input.\n\n\nNote: If you are connecting more than one device that requires HDCP 2.2 and you plan to use an HDMI splitter, be sure it also supports HDCP 2.2.\nMultiple inputs \u2013 When multiple inputs support HDCP 2.2, you may see a single label across several inputs as seen in the following example:\n\n\n\u2026 or you may see an individual label on each input as pictured below.\n\n\nEither way, assume any input that is not labeled as such does not support HDCP 2.2.

If you do not see a label but suspect your device supports HDCP 2.2, refer to the owner\u2019s manual or online user\u2019s guide. If you cannot find the HDCP version documented anywhere, contact the manufacturer to inquire further.\n\nOnce you determine all HDMI inputs support HDCP 2.2, connect your Roku player to any one of them.\nWhat if I my devices do not support HDCP 2.2?\n\nYou can still enjoy HD content. During setup, your Roku player will automatically select 720p or 1080p instead of 4K or HDR. Or you can select 720p or 1080p from Settings > Display type.

There is no \u201cpower button\u201d to press on or off. This easy-to-use design prevents confusion by enabling instant access to your player any time you turn on your TV or switch from another source (e.g., cable box, Blu-ray\u2122 player, gaming console).\n\nA permanent connection also allows your Roku player to download new OS software and channel updates automatically without interrupting your use of the player. Your streaming player only uses your internet connection when streaming, or during the occasional automatic software update. When not in use, your Roku streaming player does not use any material bandwidth of your internet connection.\n\nUSB-powered Roku streaming players\n\nSome Roku players such as the current generation models listed below can be powered through the USB port on your television. This means they will automatically power-off when you turn off the television, but it also means that they have to boot-up every time you turn on the television.\n\nRoku Express\nRoku Express 4K\nRoku Express 4K+\nRoku Streaming Stick\u00ae 4K\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K+\nRoku Streaming Stick+ Headphone Edition\nNote: The USB port on some TV\u2019s may be unable to power a Roku streaming player.\nUse the auto power savings feature\n\nWhen enabled, a feature called auto power savings allows a compatible Roku player to enter a low power mode after sitting idle for 20 minutes (meaning it is not streaming content or being controlled by a remote or mobile app). A player in this state will \"wake up\" when the TV is turned on or a button is pressed on the remote.\n\nTo learn more including which players support this feature, check out the article that explains how to use auto power savings with your Roku streaming player.\n\nUse a smart plug or power strip\n\nAlthough Roku players use very little power when not in use, you may still want the ability to power-off manually. To do this without having to remove the power cable each time, consider using a Roku Indoor Smart Plug SE that can be powered on and off from the Roku Smart Home mobile app. You can even schedule it to turn on and off at specific times. Alternatively, you can connect your player to a power strip with a power button or a smart outlet (or strip) that automatically turns off power when not in use.\n\nNote: Your Roku player will have to boot-up every time you turn on a smart plug, power strip, or smart outlet.\nLast updated on 6/1/2023, 11:55:37\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "e379665b-29d5-4fcb-80ef-c36c792d872e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2b31ac1e06fac93f5dab1d3b66f906491124b989134433972bfa4bab03053f88", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2588}, "relationships": {"1": "74509717-6fb6-4dcc-8704-a2c889df14e9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6132832-05b7-4f71-8c33-e35300c330d0": {"__data__": {"text": "How to enable the text-to-speech screen reader on your Roku\u00ae streaming device\n\nRoku\u00ae streaming devices include a text-to-speech screen reader that helps users, particularly those with visual impairments or blindness, to navigate the Roku interface and on-screen menus.

If you cannot control your Roku device, learn what to do if you are having problems with your remote.\n\nHow to enable the screen reader on your Roku device\n\nThe screen reader can be turned on or off by pressing Star  on the Roku remote four times quickly. The Star button  is located below and to the right of the directional pad on the Roku remote. The directional pad is plus-shaped and is in the center of the remote.\n\nHow to navigate the Roku interface using the screen reader\n\nWhen the screen reader is turned on, it reads the name of the current screen and your location on that screen, identifies prime actionable elements, and describes options available to you. For example, on the home screen, if you hear \u201cIn main menu, Home button, 1 of 9\u201d it means, you are on in the main menu; the highlighted item is Home, and it is identified as a button because it is an actionable item. The \"1 of 9\" portion indicates Home is in position 1 of 9 items in a list. You can navigate through this menu by pressing up or down. Pressing OK  on your remote takes you into the Home screen. The OK button  is situated at the center of the directional pad on your remote.\n\nPlease note, there are a few instances when items are arranged in a grid. For example, in Home, the channels that you have installed are arranged in a grid with three channels in a row. In that case, you will hear \u201cIn Home, Netflix, button, 1 of 15, in a grid\u201d.

The resolution of a traditional 1080p Full HD TV is limited to 1,920 columns and 1,080 rows of pixels, while a 4K Ultra HD TV has an increased resolution of 3,840 columns and 2,160 rows of pixels. With four times the resolution of 1080p, 4K Ultra HD offers improvement in picture clarity over existing HD resolutions.\n\nIn addition, some 4K TVs and some Roku streaming players support a feature called HDR (High Dynamic Range) for a wider range of colors and brightness. There are several formats of HDR, including HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision\u2122, and HLG. Not all Roku devices support all formats. You can use the device comparison chart to learn about the capabilities of current generation Roku devices that support HDR.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe following are required to enjoy HDR content on a compatible Roku player.\n\nCompatible HDR TV with an available HDMI 2.0 input that supports HDCP 2.2. For Dolby Vision or HDR10+, check with your TV manufacturer to determine if your model supports this specific standard. Make sure to check that your TV is running the latest software, and that the HDMI 2.0 input is configured to enable HDR.\nRoku player capable of streaming HDR\nGood internet connection with enough bandwidth to stream HDR (up to 25 Mbps may be needed)\nStreaming service like Netflix with a plan that supports streaming in HDR\nNote: Not all content available from a streaming service that supports HDR will appear in HDR.

This includes your TV, an AVR or soundbar, and any other devices connected in between. If even one device does not support HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2, then the HDR movie or TV show will not appear in HDR and can only be viewed in a lower resolution, such as 720p or 1080p.\n\nHDCP 2.2 is a copy and content protection standard required by the TV and movie industry. Some HDR TVs may only support HDCP 2.2 on a single HDMI input. Learn what to look for when trying to identify an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2.\n\nAudio/video connections\n\nOnce you confirm your other devices support HDMI 2.0 and you identify the inputs that support HDCP 2.2, use the instructions below to connect your Roku player.\n\nTo begin, firmly attach a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable to the HDMI port on the back of your Roku player. If you are connecting a Roku Streaming Stick, it connects directly to an HDMI input and does not require an HDMI cable.\n\nNote: The appearance of your Roku player may differ from what is depicted in the diagrams here.\n\nOnce your Roku player is ready to be connected to your other devices, use the recommended option below that matches your configuration.\n\nTip: An AVR or soundbar can be complicated to configure.

Many TVs that support HDR do not enable HDR by default. You can refer to the sample instructions that accompany the popular TV brands below, but the steps may vary from model to model, and may change when TV software is updated. When in doubt, refer to the user manual or online documentation for your specific make and model. Note that the HDR settings on some TVs are specific to each HDMI input.

Not only is playback less smooth with a lower frame rate like 30fps, but some channels like Netflix will not play 4K HDR content unless 60fps is supported.\n\nTo ensure support for the higher frame rates, the HDMI connection with your TV and any other devices like an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar must be configured to use HDMI 2.0 mode or later. This newer standard enables 4K playback at 60fps with HDR color such as HDR10 and Dolby Vision\u2122 as well.\n\nWhat HDMI settings to adjust on your TV\n\nIncorrect HDMI settings on your TV or an incompatible HDMI port may cause your streaming player to only play 1080p even when your TV is capable of 4K HDR or 4K Dolby Vision.\u00a0If you are using an HDMI port that does not support Dolby Vision at 60fps, this cannot be fixed from the TV settings.

If you have an older AVR or soundbar and you are not sure it supports HDMI 2.0 mode, you can connect your Roku player directly to your TV and then connect your AVR or soundbar separately to the HDMI ARC (or eARC) port on your TV.\n\nA note on HDMI cables\n\nRoku players that support HDR ship with an HDMI 2.0 compatible cable. If you cannot use the included cable, be sure to purchase a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable. The typically more expensive Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is a good choice for reducing potential Wi-Fi\u00ae and Bluetooth\u00ae interference, or for future-proofing an installation where the cable location is in an otherwise inaccessible area. Cables that are not labeled or may be labeled \"high speed\" or \"standard speed\" may not be adequate for 4K HDR10, HDR10+, or Dolby Vision content at 60fps.\n\nIf your Roku player is connected to an AVR or soundbar, make sure all cables are HDMI 2.0 compatible. If you see a black screen or poor performance and video degradation with a 4K HDR signal, replace any older cables with a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable.\n\nLast updated on 12/1/2022, 10:44:36\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "ad3115e7-4136-4093-a1a8-413a392cc663", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d92f32285c5a6b7a54824e5f4fcf1c75e3bccac21439aba9c4c7a6a34559fd9b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3092, "end": 5996}, "relationships": {"1": "a6472de6-0982-43db-86cc-a8a258ec9fe2", "2": "e2477629-385f-4034-b342-05f6e57d105c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "94ed2718-3528-4462-8425-84ea2bac187f": {"__data__": {"text": "Roku Smart Home software release notes\n\nRoku\u00ae Smart Home brings ease and simplicity to home monitoring, cameras, lighting, and power with super smart, but surprisingly simple, smart home products.\n\nWith the launch of the new Roku Home Monitoring system and Smart Light Strip+, new features have been added to the Roku Smart Home mobile app to help users create a safer, smarter, more customizable home.\n\nAdditionally, new updates to the Roku OS brings seamless integration between Roku Smart Home products and Roku streaming devices.\n\nFeatures of the Home Monitoring System and Light Strip+ will be available upon launch.

For additional details, read about the best settings on your Roku TV for gaming.\n\nIf you have a Roku TV that is capable of displaying movies and TV shows in High Dynamic Range, or HDR, the standard picture modes described above are only available during playback of SD, HD, and 4K (non-HDR) content. When HDR content is detected, you will be able to choose from either the HDR10 or Dolby Vision\u2122 picture modes depending on the format of the movie or TV show.\n\nHDR10 \u2013 All Roku TV models capable of displaying HDR content support the HDR10 format.\n\nDark : Balanced picture settings closest to a cinema experience\nNormal : Brighter picture settings slightly boosting colors\nBright : Vivid picture settings for much brighter colors\n\nDolby Vision \u2013 Only select Roku TV models capable of displaying HDR content support Dolby Vision.

From the same Options menu where you change picture modes (see above), select Advanced picture settings. The following settings can be adjusted.\n\nDynamic contrast: Manually adjust backlight level for the entire screen\nBacklight: Adjust peak backlight level of your TV screen\nBrightness: Adjust how dark black sections appear\nContrast: Adjust intensity of white parts of the image\nSharpness: Adjust how sharp or soft edges appear\nColor: Adjust how intense colors look\nTint: Adjust to get satisfactory skin tones\nColor Temperature: Adjust how blue or red the image appears\n\nTip: Your Roku TV stores unique picture mode settings for each video input.

When you switch between the inputs, your Roku TV remembers your preferences and switches back to the picture mode you selected for each input.\n\nLast updated on 12/30/2022, 2:36:39\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "23267055-c5fd-4819-a8e6-75891fc8cde6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6d331cc90f36b08430091c25a9a0079b1d4fb7e27b745a093fea1d1ce5006463", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4083}, "relationships": {"1": "7e947135-8b45-40bc-9e1b-63453d3f5279"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "368311ab-122b-466c-bd1a-9694a9f7f231": {"__data__": {"text": "Getting to know your Roku Video Doorbell and Chime SE\n\nWhen you are ready, download the Roku\u00ae Smart Home mobile app.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nTo learn more about your Roku Smart Home device before you begin, take a moment to review the helpful resources in this article.\n\nWhich Roku video doorbell do I have?\n\nRoku offers two models of video doorbells:\n\nRoku Video Doorbell & Chime SE (model DS1000)\u00a0\nRoku Wire-free Video Doorbell & Chime SE (model DB1000)\n\nYou can find information specific to each model in the sections that follow.

If you forget to pause and miss an important scene, your Roku TV allows you to rewind and catch up.\n\nNote: Live TV Pause is only available when watching \"over-the-air\" broadcast TV from the Live TV input. It is not available when watching live streaming TV from The Roku Channel.\nHow does it work?\n\nLive TV Pause is only available on the Live TV input of your Roku TV and requires a dedicated USB 2.0 compatible flash drive with at least 16GB of storage for recording the video. As soon as you tune to a digital channel, Live TV Pause begins recording up to 90 minutes of live television.\n\nTo pause the program, press Play/Pause  on your Roku TV remote. Even if you do not pause, you can press Rewind  at any time to rewind the current channel up to 90 minutes, or to the point where you first tuned to that channel. When you tune to another channel, leave the Live TV input, or power off the TV, the place where you paused the program will be lost.\n\nAfter being paused for 90 minutes, playback begins automatically.\n\nUSB Flash Drive Requirements\n\nLive TV Pause requires a USB 2.0 compatible flash drive with at least 16GB of storage. 16GB is the minimum size required to hold 90 minutes of paused TV. USB drives larger than 16GB will not increase the amount of pause time.\n\nWARNING: Live TV Pause will reformat the USB drive and everything on the drive will be erased. Later, if you wish to use the drive for something other than Live TV Pause it will need to be reformatted. During reformatting the drive will be tested to ensure that it can read and write fast enough to support live video recording.\n\nNote:\nIf your Roku TV has a single USB port, then you will need to alternate USB drives to use Live TV Pause and play personal media (photos, music, and video).\nIf your Roku TV has multiple USB ports, only one USB port can be used for Live TV Pause. When formatting, only the USB drive for Live TV Pause should be connected to any of USB ports. After formatting completes, you can insert a different USB drive into another USB port for playing personal media.\nThe USB drive is used only to pause live digital broadcast television and cannot be used to store recorded programs for future use, or for transferring to another device.\nEnable Live TV Pause\n\nPlug the USB drive into a USB port on the back or side of your Roku TV. If your Roku TV has more than one USB port, remove any USB drives being used for another application, such as Roku Media Player. After the USB drive is inserted, you will be prompted to reformat it. A message may prompt you to launch a media player, select Don\u2019t launch.\n\nTo enable Live TV Pause:\n\nIf not already completed, set up the Live TV input on your Roku TV. On completion you will be prompted to Set up Live TV Pause.\nIf the Live TV input is already setup, press Home  on your Roku TV remote and then perform a or b:\nHighlight the Live TV input, press Star  to bring up the Options menu and select Set up Live TV Pause.\nSelect the Live TV input to watch live television, press Play/Pause  and choose Set up Live TV Pause.\nFollow the on-screen instructions to complete setup\nDisable Live TV Pause\n\nUnplugging the USB drive will automatically disable Live TV Pause.\n\nTroubleshoot Live TV Pause\n\nYou can get help if the video is blocky or blacks out when using Live TV Pause or the paused video is lost after the screensaver appears.\n\nLast updated on 12/30/2022, 2:59:00\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "57b84d26-6a39-4bbf-a239-b63db4b18d87", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "73048a97fabc929f2c2c429ab69f9f0c61ff82259516cb0c5e119fb4caf887b2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3678}, "relationships": {"1": "3248336f-290c-43f7-a607-7600634ce2f5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b359782-e2ab-4243-992e-2c6b9fb969c5": {"__data__": {"text": "Getting to know your Roku Smart Plug SE\n\nWhen you are ready, download the Roku\u00ae Smart Home mobile app.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nTo learn more about your Roku Smart Home device before you begin, take a moment to review the helpful resources in this article.\n\nWhich Roku smart plug do I have?\n\nRoku offers two models of smart plugs:\n\nRoku Indoor Smart Plug SE (model PS1000)\nRoku Outdoor Smart Plug SE (model PW1000)\n\nYou can find information specific to each model in the sections that follow.

For detailed instructions about installing music streaming services, read about how to find and add channels on your Roku device.\n\nDo I need an account to listen to music channels?\n\nFor the best experience, most music channels require you create an account and log in to start listening to free or premium content. If you want to begin listening right away, iHeartRadio gives you access to free content without an account, but you will need to create one if you plan to subscribe to their premium services.\n\nThe sign-up process varies slightly with each music service, but typically, once you launch the channel you will see a message asking you to log in if you have an existing account, or sign up if you need to create an account. To sign up, follow the on-screen instructions and the channel will log you in as part of the process. Some music channels only provide the option to log in, with instructions to visit a website to create an account. Once you complete that process on your smartphone, tablet, or computer, you can return to your Roku device to log in to the channel.\n\nFor more help signing up for a specific music service, visit the website for that channel provider, or contact their support team.\n\nWhat you need to use voice commands\n\nBefore you can take advantage of the latest enhancements to voice search and voice control, make sure your compatible Roku streaming device is running Roku OS 9.4 or higher, and you have one of the following control devices:\n\nRoku Voice Remote\nRoku Enhanced Voice Remote\nRoku Voice Remote Pro\nRoku Touch\u2122 tabletop remote\nRoku mobile app for iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122\n\nTo learn more about which streaming devices support voice, or to determine if your existing remote has voice capabilities, read about what you need to use voice commands with your streaming device.\n\nWhat to say to listen to music with a voice command\n\nTo listen to music with a voice command, follow the instructions below.\n\nPush-to-talk voice\n\nSpeaking naturally to any Roku voice remote, press and hold the voice button  (or magnifying glass button  on older remotes) and say a voice command like, \"listen to classical music on Pandora\", \"play Stuff You Should Know on iHeartRadio\", or \"play Today's Hits on TuneIn\". Your Roku device will launch the specified channel and begin playing the music, radio station, or podcast audio.\n\nNote:\nYour remote must be paired to your Roku device for voice control to work.\nWhen using a handheld remote, hold it 2 to 3 inches from your mouth when issuing a voice command.\nWith a tabletop remote, you should be no more than 2 to 3 feet away.\nA Roku voice remote is only \"listening\" when the button is being pressed. You must press and hold to successfully issue a voice command.\n\nHands-free voice\n\nIn addition to supporting push-to-talk voice, your Roku Voice Remote Pro listens for hands-free voice commands any time the slider switch on the side of the remote is 'green'. When hands-free voice is enabled this way, you can simply say \"Hey Roku...\" with the remote nearby and add a command like \"...play Daft Punk on Spotify\". Or, say something like \"Hey Roku, listen to Radio Disney on TuneIn\" all without needing to press a button.\n\nNote:\nYour remote must be paired to your Roku device for voice control to work.\nFor the best hands-free experience, use the following guidelines:\nSpeak to the microphone in your remote, and not your TV.\nKeep your remote nearer to you than it", "doc_id": "fa41d808-7c22-4fb1-bf54-8a4d47e83248", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "461f60a3e44b5e9894b806092c332a6266f1818dfcc3c43d1d43cc72e53543c8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3504, "end": 7648}, "relationships": {"1": "7e1ed5a8-5f8a-42fd-937f-14a83778ad4e", "2": "a438b8bb-da19-41e9-97fe-6f6d5f7439b2", "3": "1bfc5158-dd7a-4715-9e1b-350401472154"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bfc5158-dd7a-4715-9e1b-350401472154": {"__data__": {"text": "You must press and hold to successfully issue a voice command.\n\nHands-free voice\n\nIn addition to supporting push-to-talk voice, your Roku Voice Remote Pro listens for hands-free voice commands any time the slider switch on the side of the remote is 'green'.

By default, all content types are set to Auto. Your Roku device tries to launch your default provider or picks one for you if you do not have one selected.\n\nIf you prefer, you can turn off the automatic setting and configure voice commands to only launch a specific app for each type of audio content you play. Remember, if you ever want to launch a specific music service, just include the channel name in the voice command (e.g., \"play hip hop on iHeartRadio\").\n\nHow to control playback with a voice command\n\nAfter you begin playing audio content on Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, or TuneIn, you can issue a voice command to your Roku voice remote similar to those below.\n\nPlayback commands\n\"fast forward\"\n\"rewind\"\n\"pause\"\n\"stop\"\n\"resume\"\n\"continue\"\n\"skip\"\n\"next\"\n\"replay\"\n\n\nInteract with your streaming service\n\"thumbs up/down\"\n\"like/dislike\"\n\"what song is this?\"\n\nRead a more comprehensive overview of the types of voice commands you can use to interact with your Roku devices.\n\nHow to listen to music when the Roku TV screen is off\n\nEnabling a feature on your Roku TV called Fast TV Start lets you listen to audio content from Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn when the TV screen is off. If you have a compatible Roku device, you can also stream audio via Bluetooth from a smartphone, tablet, or computer when the TV screen is off.\n\nAfter you enable Fast TV Start, try issuing a voice command as described above when the TV screen is off. After a brief moment, you will begin to hear audio from the speakers in your Roku TV while the screen stays off, unless of course a Roku audio device is connected. If that is the case, you will hear full, rich sound from your Roku audio device, also while the TV screen remains off. At any time, press Power  on your Roku TV remote to wake the TV screen while music continues to play.\n\nTo turn the TV screen off, simply press Star  after you begin playing music from a voice command and select Turn off display.\n\nHow to share music files with Play On Roku on the Roku mobile app\n\nThe free Roku mobile app has a feature called Play On Roku that lets you share personal media files including songs stored on your mobile device to your Roku streaming player or Roku TV.

Local dimming technology improves the contrast performance of your Roku TV system by dimming the parts of the screen that should be dark while not altering the parts of the screen that should be bright. Achieving more realistic blacks in this way causes you to see a sharper image with colors that appear more vivid and whites that seem brighter.\n\nNote: Not all TV models support local dimming (or local contrast). Roku Plus Series TVs support local dimming. Refer to the manufacturer of your TV for details.\nHow local dimming works\n\nThe backlight structure behind the front LCD screen on your TV is divided into numerous zones of tiny lights, or LEDs. Each zone is dimmed or lit up individually depending on the contrast and lighting of each scene. When local dimming is enabled, the amount of dimming in each zone is automatic with dynamic scene-by-scene detection of brightness and contrast levels.\n\nHow to adjust local dimming on your TV\n\nOn TV models that support local dimming, the feature is available in the Advanced picture settings submenu of the Options menu. To adjust local dimming, begin playback of a movie or TV show on a streaming channel, or switch to the Antenna TV, HDMI, or AV input.\n\nAfter playback begins, press Star  on your TV remote to open the Options menu\nScroll and select Advanced picture settings\nLocate the Local dimming (or local contrast) selection.\nNote: If this selection is not listed in the Advanced picture settings submenu, then your TV does not support local dimming.\nChoose the local dimming effect level using the directional pad on your TV remote.\n\nOff: Local dimming turned off and backlight is no longer controlled individually by each zone.\nLow: Local dimming enabled with small dimming range.\nMedium: Local dimming enabled with medium dimming range.\nHigh: Local dimming enabled with large dimming range.\n\nNote: When Local dimming is enabled, the Dynamic contrast setting (if it exists on your TV) is off and disabled automatically.\n\nLast updated on 4/7/2023, 8:34:30\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "122c9e17-a44b-4b7a-9be1-9f243bf70970", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5c75cb54dee837536bd3df7f14dce84240ec5958bb66f5c055930cd563698653", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2215}, "relationships": {"1": "6d8a7e52-50b0-46c2-805a-35dcf7b57a62"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "559396e4-cc95-4dac-ac3c-b226ef8d2e58": {"__data__": {"text": "How to flag inappropriate images in Photo Streams\n\nPhoto Streams lets our users share their photos with family and friends in different locations and customize their Roku experience with a personalized screensaver.

If you notice motion blur in the program you are watching, you can use Action Smoothing on your Roku TV to minimize the visual effect.\n\nNote: Not all Roku TV models support Action Smoothing. Refer to the manufacturer of your Roku TV for details.\nHow Action Smoothing works\n\nThe Action Smoothing feature reduces motion blur by applying a certain degree of smoothing to the original video signal. The amount of reduction depends on the setting you choose for Action Smoothing.\n\nOff: Action Smoothing is turned off. The original video signal remains unchanged.\nLow: Results in a slight reduction of motion blur.\nMedium: Results in a moderate reduction of motion blur.\nHigh: Results in a significant reduction of motion blur.\n\nHow to use Action Smoothing\n\nOn Roku TV models that support Action Smoothing, the feature is available in the Advanced picture settings submenu of the Options menu.\n\nDuring playback, press Star  on your Roku TV remote to open the Options menu\nScroll and select Advanced picture settings\nModify the Action Smoothing selection using the left and right buttons on the directional pad on your Roku TV remote. The directional pad is plus-shaped and is in the center of the remote.\nNote: If Action Smoothing is not listed in the Advanced picture settings submenu, then your Roku TV does not support the feature.\nMore about Action Smoothing\nWhile a higher Action Smoothing setting results in the greatest reduction of motion blur, it can introduce other undesirable side effects, such as the disappearance of small objects. In these cases, you should use a lower setting or turn Action Smoothing off.\nAction Smoothing settings are unique and persistent for every input, and for each type of content (e.g., 1080p, 4K, 4K HDR). For example, if you have a 4K Blu-ray\u2122 player connected to HDMI 1, you can assign a different Action Smoothing setting for 1080p movies, 4K movies, and 4K HDR movies. Each time you return to HDMI 1 to watch a movie, the Action Smoothing setting automatically returns to the assigned value depending on the type of content being watched.\nAction Smoothing is Off and disabled when Game mode is On for any of the HDMI or AV inputs.\nLast updated on 1/31/2022, 4:43:34\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "fdf68602-9249-445f-b630-9936008b0fa7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "014895a72726e475269514865823d3461ee6f7e33a823b98c213e6dd5710f301", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2443}, "relationships": {"1": "07815c4a-f94e-4cbc-9937-4d6c0aee74b5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a2c8843-ddd4-4ca4-9fb1-1dae896fd2c3": {"__data__": {"text": "Getting to know your Roku Express 4K or Express 4K+\n\nYour Roku\u00ae Express 4K and Roku Express 4K+ connect directly to your TV, letting you stream movies and TV shows over the internet with little effort.

Turning up the volume may help, but it may annoy others nearby. When you are watching a movie or TV show on your compatible Roku TV\u2122 system, a feature called dialog enhancement can help you better hear critical dialogue without needing to adjust the volume. Dialog enhancement works by boosting speech audio separately from background content without increasing the overall loudness of the scene.\n\nNote: Dialog enhancement may also be referred to as speech clarity on some TVs. Dialog enhancement and speech clarity function the same way. You may have either option depending on the type of content being played and the capabilities of your TV.\nHow to change dialog enhancement settings\n\nWhen streaming a movie or TV show, or watching content from an external device connected to your Roku TV system (e.g., Blu-ray\u2122 player, cable set-top box, game console), you can change dialog enhancement (or speech clarity) settings with the following instructions:\n\nBegin streaming content or switch the active input to a connected device (e.g., cable set-top box, game console)\nWhile content is playing, press Star  on your Roku remote\nSelect Sound settings\nUse the directional pad to select Dialog enhancement (or Speech clarity)\nSelect the desired dialog enhancement (or speech clarity) option\nNote:\nIn some streaming channels, Star  is assigned a different function meaning it will not open the Options menu as described above. In these cases, you must launch a different channel, such as The Roku Channel, and follow the steps above. Once the feature is switched to the desired setting, it remains when you return to the original channel.\nOn some TVs, the dialog enhancement option may appear under a different menu such as DTS Studio Sound or Sonic Emotion.\n\nDialog enhancement and speech clarity options\n\nDialog enhancement has two options:\n\nOn: Dialog enhancement is engaged, and speech audio is boosted over background content.\nOff: Dialog enhancement is not engaged, and speech audio is unmodified.\n\nSpeech clarity has four options:\n\nAuto: Adjusts speech clarity based on what you're watching.\nOff: Speech clarity is not engaged, and dialogue is unmodified.\nLow: Dialogue is slightly louder than the rest of the scene.\nHigh: Dialogue is noticeably louder than the rest of the scene.\nLast updated on 3/27/2023, 1:37:01\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "0e922c33-289d-4300-849e-d969f3f3fa6c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "99db7d712551b77635ad1b5b2365dff67a1633fca30a7ad1673d8f775ab3e427", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2514}, "relationships": {"1": "a4a753e1-7fac-434c-8e37-7698d69b664e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "76a30561-568f-4e07-a84e-206279ace0ee": {"__data__": {"text": "How to use the 'TV Off' shortcut on your Roku\u00ae streaming player\n\nThe 'TV Off' shortcut is a unique tile at the bottom of the channel grid on your Home screen that provides a convenient way for you to get your Roku streaming player to tell your TV to power off. Using the shortcut tile saves you from having to pick up your TV remote each time you want to power off the TV screen.\n\nTo help use the shortcut successfully, this article explains how to properly connect your Roku player to your TV, and configure each device.\n\nHow to connect your player\n\nFor your Roku player to reliably send a command like \"power off\" to your TV, you must use an HDMI\u00ae cable and connect your player directly to your TV. To take full advantage of the capabilities of your TV, it is important you use the correct HDMI cable. If your TV only supports HD, you can use a High Speed HDMI Cable. If it also supports 4K Ultra HD and/or HDR, connect your player using a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable.\n\nNote:\nIf your player is a Roku Streaming Stick\u00ae you do not need to use an HDMI cable considering it connects directly to an HDMI port on your TV.\nUsing an HDMI cable, you can connect your player to an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar which is connected to your TV (also with an HDMI cable), but keep in mind that communication passed over HDMI between multiple devices may not always be reliable. If you encounter issues with this configuration, try connecting your player directly to your TV with the proper HDMI cable.\nHow to configure each device\n\nOnce your player is connected to your TV with the proper HDMI cable, a feature called CEC must be enabled on both devices. CEC, or Consumer Electronics Control, allows commands to be shared between devices over the same HDMI connection as audio and video, letting you control common functions of different devices without having to juggle remotes. In this case, CEC lets you use the 'TV Off' shortcut to easily turn your TV screen off.\n\nNote: CEC does not allow control of all aspects of every device. For some functions, you may still need to use the original remote for a device.\n\nYou can enable CEC on your Roku player from the Settings menu using the steps below.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Control other devices (CEC)\nHighlight 1-touch play\nCheck the box to enable 1-touch play\n\nAfter you enable CEC on your Roku player, CEC must also be enabled on your TV (and AVR or soundbar if your player is connected to either of these devices). When looking through menus for CEC on your TV (or other devices), understand that manufacturers may not refer to it by name, but rather as part of a branded trade name (e.g., Samsung uses 'Anynet'; Sony calls it 'BRAVIA Link' or 'Bravia Sync'). In general, you can often look in a \"settings\" menu for CEC-related settings, sometimes in a \"system\" or \"advanced\" submenu. You can refer to sample instructions for some TV brands, but steps vary from model to model, and may change when TV software is updated. When in doubt, refer to the user manual or online documentation for your specific make and model.\n\nNote: In addition to enabling CEC, some brands may include options specifically related to allowing the TV to be powered off. Be sure to enable these options if your TV supports them. Contact the manufacturer if you have questions.\nHow to use the shortcut\n\nAfter you finish connecting your Roku player to your TV with an HDMI cable and both devices have CEC turned on, you can visit the channel grid to use the 'TV Off' shortcut.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nMove right or select Home to open the channel grid\nScroll to find the 'TV Off' shortcut tile\nTip: All shortcut tiles are permanently located at the bottom of the channel grid.

To activate 1-touch play, you simply need to press any button on your Roku remote (except for volume or mute buttons if present). In addition to switching the active source/input, most televisions will also power on.\n\nFor 1-touch play to work, the feature must be enabled on both your Roku player (instructions provided above) and your TV. Refer to the website for the manufacturer or read the user manual for help enabling 1-touch play on your TV.\n\nOther ways to control your TV\n\nIn addition to methods described in this article, you can use a Roku voice remote with dedicated power and volume buttons to control aspects of the TV connected to your Roku streaming device. To check if you already have a Roku voice remote with TV controls, review guidelines for determining the type of remote you have.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you are having trouble, review the suggestions below.\n\nThe 'TV Off' shortcut tile does not work\n\nIf your TV does not power off when you select the 'TV Off' shortcut tile, check the following:\n\nIs your Roku player connected using an HDMI cable? Other types of audio/video cables like composite (RCA) or optical cables do not allow communication between devices. You must use an HDMI cable.\nIs your player connected directly to your TV? If it is connected to an AVR or soundbar, bypass this other device and connect it directly to your TV (at least temporarily as a test).\nDoes your Roku player have CEC turned on? Use the instructions above to check this setting.\nHave you enabled CEC on your TV and any CEC power options? Contact the manufacturer of your TV if you cannot find the CEC settings on your TV.\nI cannot find the 'TV Off' shortcut\n\nIf after scrolling to the bottom of the channel grid you cannot find the 'TV Off' shortcut tile, it is possible that this tile or all shortcut tiles are hidden on your Roku player. Use the instructions below to display the shortcut again.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect Home screen\nSelect Shortcuts\nScroll to the 'TV Off' shortcut\nMake sure the box is checked. If not, press OK  on your remote to check the box and display the shortcut again.\nLast updated on 1/24/2022, 10:37:36\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "b3a8b404-c445-401e-bfb1-39877cb34c26", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "90129061b7ea3dd22d5c8663593aafa16c2a480acb5ac18f07f20223677a25b7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3257, "end": 6392}, "relationships": {"1": "0565e44b-41f1-40b1-9bbd-af785f08eb4c", "2": "76a30561-568f-4e07-a84e-206279ace0ee"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a73339b0-449b-49bb-a1a3-7f114cfa90f3": {"__data__": {"text": "How to adjust ambient light sensing on your Roku TV system\n\nWhether viewing in a room filled with sunlight or a dark environment at night, Roku TV\u2122 systems equipped with an ambient light sensor can automatically adjust the brightness of the picture to provide a consistent viewing experience during varying lighting conditions.

You only need to attach the power cable and pair your soundbar to your Roku TV. Once connected, you will experience big-picture sound from streaming channels, over-the-air TV from an antenna, and external devices connect to your TV like a Blu-ray\u2122 player, or cable or satellite set-top box.\n\nYou can also use your Roku TV Wireless Soundbar to play audio from Bluetooth\u00ae devices like a smartphone, tablet, or computer. Simply pair your Bluetooth device and play music, podcasts, or any other audio from apps installed on your Bluetooth device to your wireless soundbar \u2013 all without needing to have your TV screen on.\n\nWhat devices can I connect my Roku TV Wireless Soundbar to?\n\nA Roku TV Wireless Soundbar is designed to work exclusively with your Roku TV and cannot be connected to any other type of TV, or a Roku streaming player.\n\nThere is a difference between a Roku TV and a Roku player or Roku Streaming Stick\u00ae. A Roku TV is a standalone smart TV with built-in TV display, Roku OS and the ability to stream content over the internet, watch live TV with an antenna, and access connected devices like a cable set-top box or Blu-ray player. Roku players on the other hand, are like cable set-top boxes and must be connected to a TV using an HDMI\u00ae cable to start streaming content over the internet. A Roku Streaming Stick must also be connected to a TV, but it plugs directly into the HDMI port on a TV.\n\nLearn how to determine if you have a Roku TV.\n\nWhat you need for setup\n\nIn addition to your Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, you will need the following:\n\nPower for your soundbar: If there is no wall outlet nearby, you may want to use a power extension cable (not included).\nConnection to the internet: To check that your Roku TV is connected to the internet, go to Settings > Network > About and check that Status says \"Connected\". If you need help making the connection, learn how to connect your Roku TV to the internet.\nRoku TV remote: To get your Roku TV into pairing mode and initiate the setup process, you will need your existing Roku TV remote.\nRoku OS version 10.0 or higher: Continue reading this article to learn how you can check the software version and initiate a manual update if necessary.\n\nBe aware that after your wireless soundbar is set up, the speakers inside your Roku TV will be disabled. For additional setup information, review the instructions included from the manufacturer or visit their website.\n\nIf you need additional setup help, you can read the Roku TV Wireless Soundbar Quick Start Guide.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhere to install your wireless soundbar\n\nWhen you install your wireless soundbar, it should be centered with the television screen to best anchor the sound to the picture. Whether you choose to simply place it on a piece of furniture in front of your TV or mount it to the wall or directly to the TV (or TV bracket), avoid installing it where sound may reflect off a nearby flat surface like a TV stand, shelf, or table. Sound reflections like these combine with non-reflecting sound traveling directly from your wireless soundbar to negatively affect the sound-quality. The result is an effect known as comb filtering that makes what you hear less crisp and sharp, especially with higher frequencies like dialogue.

Connect your soundbar to the HDMI\u00ae ARC port on your Roku TV, complete the easy setup process, and begin enjoying an upgraded audio experience in no time. This article helps you determine if your soundbar is Roku TV Ready certified and outlines the setup process in more detail.\n\nHow to tell if your soundbar is certified\n\nTo determine if your soundbar is Roku TV Ready certified, look for the certification logo (seen below) on the original packaging or user manual, or visit the product details page on the manufacturer's website.\n\nHow to find the HDMI ARC port on your Roku TV\n\nFor your Roku TV Ready soundbar to work seamlessly with your Roku TV, you must connect it to the HDMI ARC port, or HDMI eARC port as it is labeled on some Roku TV models. HDMI ARC lets your Roku TV send audio from streaming channels, the built-in TV tuner, and connected devices like a Blu-ray\u2122 player, game console, or cable/satellite set-top box without the need for additional cables. HDMI eARC works the same, but also offers support for advanced surround sound formats with higher audio quality and has built-in audio and video \"lip-sync\". If you want to learn more about the differences, refer to the detailed article about ARC and eARC on your Roku TV.\n\nUse the guidelines below to help identify the HDMI ARC (or HDMI eARC) port on your Roku TV.\n\nHDMI ARC\n\nThe HDMI ARC (or Audio Return Channel) connection is located among the other HDMI ports, and is often labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or just \"ARC\". When connecting your soundbar, you will use an HDMI cable.\n\nHDMI eARC (select Roku TV models only)\n\nThe HDMI eARC (or Enhanced Audio Return Channel) connection is located with the other HDMI ports and is commonly labeled \"HDMI eARC\" or simply \"eARC\". To take full advantage of the benefits of eARC, your Roku TV Ready Soundbar must support eARC and you need to connect it using a High Speed HDMI Cable with support for Ethernet.\n\nNote: A soundbar that supports eARC can be connected to an ARC port for standard ARC functionality. Similarly, a soundbar that only supports ARC can be connected to an eARC port for the same standard ARC functionality.\n\nIf another device is already using the HDMI ARC (or HDMI eARC) port, consider moving that device to a different HDMI port before you connect your Roku TV Ready soundbar.\n\nHow to begin the setup process\n\nConnect a single HDMI cable from your soundbar to the HDMI ARC (or HDMI eARC) port on your Roku TV, and make sure both devices are powered on. When your Roku TV detects the soundbar, it will automatically initiate the setup process. Follow the simple on-screen instructions to finish setting up the connection.\n\nWhy do I see a message that my soundbar is plugged into the wrong port?\n\nIt is important to understand that not all HDMI ports are created equal. Only the HDMI ARC (or HDMI eARC) port allows your soundbar and Roku TV to properly communicate back and forth with each other over the HDMI cable. Double-check the connection and make sure your soundbar is connected to the HDMI port specifically labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or \"ARC\" (or \"HDMI eARC\" or \"eARC\").\n\nNote: The sample diagrams above are not intended to be an exact depiction of the connections on your Roku TV.

HDMI also includes a couple lesser-known features called HDMI-CEC and ARC that use two-way communication over the same connection to simplify how you use and set up your entertainment system. However, before you can take advantage of these benefits it is important you check the settings on your TV and make sure the features are enabled. It is not uncommon for them to be disabled by default.\n\nThis article provides more details about HDMI-CEC and ARC, and outlines steps to enable the features for several common TV brands.\n\nWhat is HDMI-CEC?\n\nCEC, or Consumer Electronics Control, allows commands to be shared between devices over the same HDMI connection as audio and video, letting you control common functions of different devices without having to juggle remotes. For example, with CEC enabled you can use your TV remote to adjust the volume of a connected audio device such as a Roku Streambar\u00ae, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar. Or, with your Roku remote you can easily turn your TV on and off without needing to pick up another remote.\n\nNote: CEC does not allow control of all aspects of every device. For some functions, you may still need to use the original remote for a device.\nWhat is ARC?\n\nARC, or Audio Return Channel, lets your TV send audio to an external audio device such as a Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar without the need for additional cables. This allows audio from your TV's tuner and devices connected to your TV such as a Blu-ray player, game console, cable/satellite set-top box to be enjoyed on an audio device other than your TV's built-in speakers. To use this feature, the audio device must be connected to the \"HDMI ARC\" or \"ARC\" port, which is common on smart TVs manufactured in 2009 or later.\n\nNote: Consult the user manual or online documentation for your TV if you are not sure your TV has an ARC port.\nHow to enable CEC and ARC\n\nEnabling CEC and ARC is different for every TV brand. Some have separate settings for each, while others combine the features into one setting that turns ARC and CEC on or off at the same time. When looking through your TV's menus for these features, understand that manufacturers may not refer to them by name, but rather as part of a branded trade name. In general, you can often look in a \"settings\" menu for CEC-related settings, sometimes in a \"system\" or \"advanced\" submenu. ARC-related settings may be located in the same place, or they may appear separately in an \"audio\" or \"sound\" menu.\n\nEach brand in the list below includes the trade name(s) in parenthesis that the manufacturer typically uses when referring to the features in their TV menus.

You can fine-tune your listening experience with music, movies, TV shows, and more with the different sound settings. The sound settings described in this article do not appear when a Roku TV Ready\u2122 soundbar is connected to your Roku TV\u2122. To adjust sound settings for your Roku TV Ready soundbar, learn how you can access manufacturer-specific sound modes directly on your Roku TV screen.\n\nThis article provides more details surrounding the various sound settings available with your Roku audio device(s) and helps you adjust them. Before you can use any of the settings, you must first set up or connect your Roku audio device(s).\n\nSet up your Roku Streambar\u00ae\nSet up your Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar\nSet up your Roku TV Wireless Soundbar\nSet up your Roku wireless speakers\nSet up your Roku subwoofer\nWhat sound settings are available on my Roku audio device?\n\nThe following sound settings may be available on your Roku audio device.\n\nSound modes: Adjust the audio track to hear less bass or more bass\nSpeech clarity: Boost dialogue content relative to other sounds (e.g., background music, car crashes, etc.)\nVolume modes: Automatic leveling and night mode offer varying levels to lower volume on loud scenes and boost volume on quieter scenes\nTreble: Increase high frequencies for a \"brighter\", more detailed sound, or lower them for a softer sound.\nBass: Adjust low frequencies, or the sounds you feel, such as loud explosions in a movie or the bass drum kicks in a concert performance.\n\nWith a Roku Streambar\u00ae Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar, you can also adjust the Virtual surround setting to create a spacious sound experience with everything you watch. If you connect Roku wireless speakers as surround sound speakers to your Streambar or Smart Soundbar, then you can also change the Expanded stereo and Surround level settings.\u00a0\n\nLearn more about all of these settings in the sections below.\n\nNote: Not all sound settings are available on all devices.\nSound modes\n\nWhether you are listening to music, or watching a movie or TV show, there are times you may want to hear more bass or less bass. When your Roku audio device is connected, you can adjust sound modes to reduce or increase the bass you hear in the audio track with the following choices:\n\nReduce bass: Reduces bass frequencies\nNormal: Provides a flat frequency response, leaving bass frequencies unaltered\nBass boost: Increases bass frequencies\nBass off: Turns off bass frequencies\nNote:\nThe sound modes described above are only available when using a Roku audio device. When a Roku audio device is not connected, other sound modes are available on your Roku TV, but the choices vary based on the manufacturer.\nSound modes are not specific to any content, and the one you choose is purely based on your listening preference.\nSpeech clarity\n\nWhen watching a movie or a TV show, spoken dialogue can sometimes get lost amidst other sounds in a busy scene. Turning up the volume may help, but it may annoy others nearby. When your Roku audio device is connected, a feature called speech clarity can help you better hear critical dialogue without needing to adjust the volume. Speech clarity works by boosting dialogue separately from background content without increasing the overall loudness of the scene.\n\nThere are three speech clarity choices:\n\nOff: Speech clarity is not engaged, and dialogue is unmodified.\nLow: Dialogue is slightly louder than the rest of the scene.\nHigh: Dialogue is noticeably louder than the rest of the scene.\n\nSpeech clarity is only available when using a Roku audio device. For more information, read the detailed article about how to use speech clarity.\n\nVolume modes\n\nMovies and television shows can have a wide range of sounds that may be challenging to always hear, especially when it is late at night, or you are in an environment with others nearby.

For more information, read the detailed article about volume modes.\n\nVirtual surround\n\nWhen listening to your Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar, you can turn on virtual surround to enjoy a rich and immersive sound experience from all your favorite entertainment. When a Dolby audio (5.1) surround format is detected, all the surround channels are processed individually and recombined for a spacious and cinematic effect that moves around your room. When listening to a stereo source like music, left and right channels are upmixed and processed intelligently to create an enhanced audio experience that brings you closer to the performance.\n\nVirtual surround is available when you use one of the audio devices listed below on its own or paired with the optional Roku Wireless Bass or Roku Wireless Bass Pro.\n\nRoku Streambar Pro (model 9101R2)\nRoku Smart Soundbar (model 9101)\nonn.\u2122 \u2022 Roku Smart Soundbar (model 9100)\n\nIf you have Roku wireless speakers connected to your Streambar or Smart Soundbar, Virtual surround is not an option since you have a real surround sound system. If you wish to adjust surround sound settings with this configuration, you can use the expanded stereo setting described in the next section.\n\nExpanded stereo\n\nIf you are using a Roku surround sound system, you may not hear audio in the surround speakers when listening to content that is in stereo sound (and not a surround sound format). To hear audio from your wireless speakers in these cases, you can change the expanded stereo sound setting during playback to one of the following choices:\n\nMovies and TV: Makes stereo sound feel like surround sound.\nMusic: Uses all speakers to fill your room with stereo sound.\nOff: Stereo sound only plays from front speakers.\nNote: Music is not typically in a surround sound format along with some movies and TV shows. You can generally look at the details of a piece of content for an audio description such as \"5.1\", \"Dolby Digital Plus 5.1\", \"Dolby Surround\", or \"Dolby Atmos\". If the content does not specifically say it includes a surround sound format, then it likely does not.\nAdjust settings during playback\n\nWhen streaming a movie, TV show, music, or Bluetooth\u00ae audio; or when watching content from an external device connected to your Roku TV (e.g., Blu-ray\u2122 player, cable set-top box, game console), you can adjust any of the sound settings listed above from the Options menu as described below.\n\nBegin streaming content, or, to adjust sound settings for a device connected to your Roku TV, switch the active input to this external device.\n\nNote: If you have a Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar and you are watching content from an external device connected to your TV, you cannot adjust sound settings during playback.

When you find the sound setting you wish to adjust, you can make your selections using the directional pad. The directional pad is plus-shaped and is in the center of your Roku remote.\n\nNote: In some streaming channels, Star  is assigned a different function meaning it will not open the Options menu as described above. In these cases, you can install the free Roku mobile app for iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122 and adjust sound settings there.\nAdjust settings from the Settings menu\n\nWhether you are streaming content on your Roku audio device or using an external device (e.g., Blu-ray player, cable set-top box, game console), you can adjust sound settings at any time using the instructions below. If you are using an external device with a Streambar or Smart Soundbar, switch your TV to the input where your Streambar or Smart Soundbar is connected before you begin.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect Audio\n\nOnce you see the Audio menu, use the directional pad on your remote to access a sound setting and press OK  to make a selection.\n\nNote: Not all sound settings are available on this menu.

When you are done with setup, you can store your existing remote away as a backup.\n\nWhat is a Roku Touch tabletop remote?\n\nRoku Touch is a tabletop remote that lets you use voice commands or simple buttons to quickly start playback of music, or control your Roku TV and speakers. With no wires, the battery-powered remote can be placed anywhere you can hear your wireless speakers. Start playing music as you walk past an entryway table or kitchen counter, or begin listening to your favorite music station as you work at a nearby desk.\n\nNote: The location must be within listening distance of your Roku TV and wireless speakers.\n\nAfter Fast TV Start is enabled, the setup process will automatically take you to the Pair remotes screen.\n\nIf you are not pairing any voice remotes, select No, I'll pair them later to end the setup process. To pair your voice remotes at a later time, go to Settings > Remotes & devices > Set up a new device.\n\nTo pair your voice remotes now, follow along with the steps below.\n\nSelect Yes, pair remotes to begin\nRemove the battery cover and insert batteries into one of your voice remotes.

However, your Roku TV uses your wireless network to initially discover and pair the speakers. Some Roku TV models may disable their wireless network connection if a wired Ethernet cable is connected. If your Roku TV is connected to a wired network and cannot find your wireless speakers, try temporarily disconnecting the Ethernet cable and connecting to your wireless network. If you need help, learn how you can connect your Roku TV to your wireless network.\n\nOnce your Roku wireless speakers are connected to your Roku TV, you can disconnect from your wireless network and reconnect the Ethernet cable.

Just connect your streambar to your TV with the included Premium High Speed HDMI\u00ae cable, connect your streambar to the internet, and complete the easy setup process. You will be listening to powerful sound from all your entertainment sources in no time. For deeper, richer bass you can also add a Roku Wireless Bass or Roku Wireless Bass Pro. And, for immersive surround effects you can add Roku wireless speakers to the back of your room, or install a pair in the front of your room and another in the back for a true 5.1 surround sound experience.\n\nYour Streambar includes a Roku voice remote with TV controls. This article describes the product in more detail and outlines the setup process whether you are connecting your Roku Streambar to a Roku TV\u2122 or a non-Roku TV.\n\nWill a Roku Streambar work with my TV?\n\nA Roku Streambar will work with any television with an available HDMI port, but to simplify connections, we recommend using a special type of HDMI port called an ARC port. When using this port, you do not need to connect an additional cable to get audio from your TV (and connected devices) to your Roku Streambar. Instead, ARC (or Audio Return Channel) uses a single HDMI cable to send streaming video from your Streambar to your TV, and audio from your TV (and connected devices) back to your Streambar. Smart TV's manufactured in 2009 and later typically have one ARC port (among the other HDMI ports) commonly labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or \"ARC\". If another device is already using the ARC port, consider moving that device to a different HDMI port \u2013 only one device can be connected to the ARC port.\n\nIf your TV does not have an ARC port, you can still use your Roku Streambar to get exceptional sound from your TV's built-in tuner and other devices connected to your TV, but you will need to connect a second cable. In addition to the HDMI cable, you need to connect an optical cable to your TV's optical output, sometimes labeled \"Digital audio out\" or \"Digital output\". This connection carries TV audio to your Streambar, while the HDMI connection delivers video from the streaming player in your Streambar to your TV. If you need to use the optical port, visit the settings on your TV to make sure the output is active, or enabled.\n\nNote:\nConsult online documentation or the user manual for your TV if you are not sure your TV has an ARC port or need help finding settings for the optical port.\nWhen using an optical cable, be sure to remove the protective plastic cap from each end of the cable before inserting the connectors. Failing to do so may result in a faulty connection, or damage to the cable or optical port.\nYou do not need to connect an optical cable when using the ARC port.\nDo I need to adjust my TV settings?\n\nIf you are connecting your Roku Streambar to the ARC port, it is important you check the settings on your TV since ARC and related features may be disabled by default. If ARC is disabled, the ARC port will behave like a normal HDMI port and you will not hear audio from your TV (and connected devices) on your Roku Streambar.\n\nYou should also check the status of a related feature called HDMI-CEC (or just CEC) that helps simplify how you use your entertainment system. CEC allows commands to be shared between devices over the same HDMI connection you use for audio and video, letting you control common features of different devices without having to juggle remotes. If CEC is disabled, you will not be able to use your Streambar remote to turn on or off your TV, or your TV remote to control volume on your Streambar.\n\nNote: The power button on the remote for your Roku Streambar works with most televisions. If your TV is not compatible, continue using your TV remote to turn your television on and off.\n\nWhen you are looking for these settings on your TV, keep", "doc_id": "bcec2f35-c767-42c3-9428-4535e78e34e8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "df3ade92502eaf1587887c5372e67b36e6d68245835e2f35b58e161535c12fa2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4176}, "relationships": {"1": "0ff6ca3d-f34b-40b0-8e95-f4dde6ff0a03", "3": "cc90908c-f982-4497-aa11-a882010853f8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc90908c-f982-4497-aa11-a882010853f8": {"__data__": {"text": "a normal HDMI port and you will not hear audio from your TV (and connected devices) on your Roku Streambar.\n\nYou should also check the status of a related feature called HDMI-CEC (or just CEC) that helps simplify how you use your entertainment system.

Some manufacturers even combine ARC and CEC into a single setting like Samsung's Anynet+. For help understanding the various trade names, review the detailed article describing how several popular TV brands go about enabling ARC and CEC.\n\nWhere to install your Streambar\n\nWhen you install your Roku Streambar, it should be centered with the television screen to best anchor the sound to the picture. Whether you choose to simply place it on a piece of furniture in front of your TV, or mount it to the wall or directly to the TV (or TV bracket), avoid installing it where sound may reflect off a nearby flat surface like a TV stand, shelf, or table. Sound reflections like these combine with non-reflecting sound traveling directly from your Streambar to negatively affect the sound-quality. The result is an effect known as comb filtering that makes what you hear less crisp and sharp, especially with higher frequencies like dialogue. This \"muddy\" sound can be avoided by installing your Roku Streambar using the guidelines below:\n\nMatch the front edges: When placing your Roku Streambar on a piece of furniture, the front edge of your Streambar should be flush with the front edge of any TV stand, shelf, or table. If it is set back too far from the front edge of the flat surface, sound will reflect.\nAvoid enclosing your Streambar: Avoid placing your Streambar inside a closed space like a cabinet or TV stand. If you have no better alternative, make sure the front edge of your Roku Streambar is flush with the front edge of the shelf (inside the cabinet or TV stand).\nNo obstructions: The area in front of your Streambar should be free of objects such as picture frames, ornaments, plants, etc. High frequencies like dialogue are affected more by these obstructions than low frequencies.\nMount it: If you do not have an ideal location on a piece of furniture, consider mounting your Roku Streambar.\nSetup resources\n\nIf you need additional setup help, you can follow along with the tutorial video, or read the quick start guide below.\n\n Roku Streambar Quick Start Guide (model 9102)\n\nConnect your Streambar\n\nAfter you identify the ARC port and make sure ARC and CEC are enabled on your TV, use the steps below to connect your Roku Streambar.\n\nUse the included power cable and connect your Roku Streambar to a wall outlet, surge protector, or extension cord.\nWith the included Premium High Speed HDMI Cable, connect your Streambar to the ARC port on your TV.\n\nNote: If you did not check earlier, make sure ARC and CEC are enabled on your TV.\n\nIf you are not using ARC, use the Premium High Speed HDMI Cable to connect your Streambar to any available HDMI port, and connect the included optical cable to the digital audio output on your TV.\n\nAfter the connections are made and your Streambar powers on, make sure the correct input is selected on your TV (the input to which your Roku Streambar is connected).

For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.\n\nLast updated on 3/27/2023, 9:37:17\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "50527bf2-4320-4467-849e-a4022b662e35", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4d7e1db99cebe504d11c73e5149bb5315da04b71203e735942f3f12eb5025233", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7585, "end": 9945}, "relationships": {"1": "8ec87ea4-f036-478a-82c7-aad05b9d1c5c", "2": "e936a9f7-6874-40cf-a4bf-8a22a25974c2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cdd378a-bca5-4776-bbba-8d44b9c52f24": {"__data__": {"text": "Why is there no sound on my Roku TV Ready\u2122 soundbar?\n\nWhen your Roku TV Ready soundbar is connected to your Roku TV and everything is working properly, you should hear sound coming from your soundbar. If you do not hear any sound at all or you only hear sound on the speakers built into your TV, you should check the common issues listed in the first section below. If these do not help, you can read on to learn how devices communicate over HDMI\u00ae, why a breakdown with this communication can cause an issue, and what you can do to successfully get sound on your soundbar.\n\nWhat to check first\n\nIt is important to first make sure your soundbar is not muted, and volume is at an audible level. When pressing buttons on your remote to adjust volume, a visual indicator should appear on the TV screen that matches the volume level of your soundbar. If you do not see this visual indicator, try installing a fresh set of matching batteries in your remote and check again.\n\nIf the behavior continues, check that your soundbar is properly connected to the HDMI ARC port on your Roku TV, and that you have completed the Roku TV Ready setup process. If your soundbar has not been set up, you can expect to only hear sound from the speakers built into your TV when adjusting the volume.\n\nOne more thing to check is the input that is selected on your Roku TV Ready soundbar. If Bluetooth or an auxiliary input is selected, you will not hear any TV sound on your soundbar when using your Roku TV. You must switch your soundbar to the HDMI input anytime you want to hear TV sound on your soundbar.\n\nIf you still hear no sound after checking all the common issues, you should investigate the HDMI connection.\n\nHow devices communicate over HDMI\n\nYour Roku TV can output sound in various audio formats that include stereo (PCM), Dolby Digital\u2122, Dolby Digital Plus\u2122, and DTS\u00ae, and your Roku TV Ready soundbar can play various audio formats based on the capabilities of components integrated by the manufacturer. To understand which audio formats are supported by your soundbar, your Roku TV communicates over the HDMI connection using CEC and ARC, and based on the information gathered, it only outputs supported audio formats and avoids sending any formats your soundbar cannot play.\n\nHowever, if audio capabilities are not communicated correctly or they get misinterpreted for some reason, your Roku TV may output an unsupported audio format leading to no sound from your soundbar. Should this happen, there are a couple things to investigate with the HDMI ARC connection and related settings.\n\nWhat to try with the physical HDMI connection\n\nBefore you look at settings related to the connection, try restoring a possible breakdown in communication using the suggestions below.\n\nDisconnect and reconnect the HDMI cable. Unplug both ends of the HDMI cable that connects your soundbar and Roku TV. Wait a moment and then firmly reattach both ends of the HDMI cable, making sure to use the HDMI ARC port on your TV.\n\nIf the behavior persists:\n\nPower cycle your soundbar and TV. Unplug the power cord from both your Roku TV Ready soundbar and your Roku TV. After a few moments, plug the cords back in and power on both devices. Test again.\nHDMI audio settings to check\n\nAs previously explained, the audio formats being output from your Roku TV need to match the capabilities of your soundbar. Your Roku TV is likely configured to automatically detect these audio capabilities, but it can be manually set to output only the formats supported by your soundbar.

If you continue to hear no sound with this selection, contact the manufacturer of your soundbar to inquire about a potential hardware issue.\nLast updated on 1/7/2022, 2:26:22\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "f0c454fa-48f6-4dfa-a059-0cb54f8cd968", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "663bb40779d04f8a162636f2ca2996aab46bfe96fc4c4cb538388c749741f159", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3375, "end": 4970}, "relationships": {"1": "eaf548d6-3cbb-4670-b629-6a3687bc4ba7", "2": "9cdd378a-bca5-4776-bbba-8d44b9c52f24"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9344a718-ee8d-440e-8df9-12919aacf402": {"__data__": {"text": "What is the best placement for my Roku subwoofer?\n\nYour Roku\u00ae subwoofer works together with a Roku Streambar\u00ae, Roku Streambar Pro, Roku Smart Soundbar, Roku wireless speakers, or Roku TV\u2122 Wireless Soundbar to produce the full range of sound you hear from your favorite movies, TV shows, songs, and more. Your Roku subwoofer generates the low frequencies, or bass, while your other Roku audio device(s) generate the middle and high frequencies. These low frequencies are much less directional than middle and high frequencies, meaning it is difficult to detect where the bass is coming from. For this reason, you can place your Roku subwoofer just about anywhere in the room and still get the illusion that the bass is coming from all around you.\n\nWith that said, you do need to install your Roku subwoofer within 30 feet of a Roku host audio device such as your Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, Roku Smart Soundbar, or Roku TV (when Roku wireless speakers or Roku TV Wireless Soundbar is connected). There are some additional factors discussed in this article that can affect the quality of the sound and ultimately help you determine where best to place your subwoofer.\n\nWhat should I look for in a good location?\n\nEven though it is difficult to detect where low frequencies originate, the physical location and other nearby objects can affect the performance of your Roku Wireless Subwoofer. Use the guidelines below to help identify potential locations.\n\nFind a power outlet: Your Roku subwoofer needs to be plugged into a working power outlet, or a power extension cable may be necessary.\nKeep it in the same room: Bass can travel through walls, but not at the same volume or quality. For the best performance, keep your subwoofer in the same room as your TV. Putting it in another room can also have negative effects on wireless connectivity.\nTry an out-of-the-way location: You may want to hide your wireless subwoofer behind a couch or large houseplant in the corner.\nConsider the front of the room: Putting your subwoofer in front of the room, to the right or left of the TV may provide the best blending with the higher frequencies generated by your other Roku audio device(s).\nAvoid placement inside a cabinet: A subwoofer enclosure is essentially a cabinet. Putting it inside another cabinet, especially one with a closed door, can have a negative effect on the bass performance.\nCheck for proper ventilation: Avoid placing your subwoofer somewhere it may overheat like on top of a heater vent or near a fireplace.\n\nAfter you identify two or three potential locations, plug the power cable into the wall outlet in the first location and set up your Roku subwoofer.\n\nHow do I evaluate each location?\n\nOnce your subwoofer is set up in the first potential location, play a song or movie with a good amount of bass, and return to your couch to listen intently. Using the suggestions below, evaluate the quality of the sound in this position.\n\nToo much bass: Sound waves reflect off other surfaces especially a flat surface like a wall. If you hear too much bass, try moving your subwoofer 6 to 12 inches away from the wall or other surface.\nNot enough bass: If you are a bass-lover, try placing your subwoofer in a corner or closer to a wall. This typically produces louder bass.\n\nRepeat the test with your subwoofer placed in each of the other potential locations, making sure to evaluate the sound using the same song or movie each time. Remember to experiment with each location, moving your subwoofer a couple feet one way or the other at each potential location. In the end, place your subwoofer where the bass sounds the best to you.\n\nLast updated on 11/7/2022, 5:00:01\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "9344a718-ee8d-440e-8df9-12919aacf402", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7d7ae76cb7079ed929259b90e05a2c1224040ac5927d834c2e35566eefb81277", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3714}, "relationships": {"1": "94daf7e7-1632-48cc-bc26-c0c6e186577a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "948e00d7-cb03-4768-93ae-51bfc4507f58": {"__data__": {"text": "How to set up your Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar\n\nYour Roku\u00ae Streambar\u00ae Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar is a 2-in-1 upgrade that adds both high definition 4K streaming and premium high quality audio to any TV. You can also add the same amazing sound to your TV's built-in tuner and enhance the audio experience of any other device connected to your TV, such as a Blu-ray\u2122 player, game console, or cable set-top box. Just connect your streambar or soundbar to your TV with the included Premium High Speed HDMI\u00ae cable, connect your streambar or soundbar to the internet, and complete the easy setup process. You will be listening to powerful sound from all your entertainment sources in no time. For deeper, richer bass you can also add a Roku Wireless Bass or Roku Wireless Bass Pro. And, for immersive surround effects you can add Roku wireless speakers to the back of your room, or install a pair in the front of your room and another in the back for a full 5.1 surround sound experience.\n\nThere are two varieties of the product, both with the same exceptional audio quality and a streaming player built in. The onn.\u2122 \u2022 Roku Smart Soundbar sold exclusively at Walmart (model 9100) includes a Roku simple remote, while the Roku Streambar Pro (model 9101R2) and Roku Smart Soundbar (model 9101) available from Roku.com and other retailers include a Roku voice remote with TV controls. This article describes both varieties in more detail and outlines the setup process whether you are connecting your Streambar or soundbar to a Roku TV\u2122 or a non-Roku TV.\n\nWill a Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar work with my TV?\n\nA Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar will work with any television with an available HDMI port, but to simplify connections, we recommend using a special type of HDMI port called an ARC port. When using this port, you do not need to connect an additional cable to get audio from your TV (and connected devices) to your Streambar or soundbar. Instead, ARC (or Audio Return Channel) uses a single HDMI cable to send streaming video from the Streambar or soundbar to the TV, and audio from the TV (and connected devices) back to the Streambar or soundbar. Smart TVs manufactured in 2009 and later typically have one ARC port (among the other HDMI ports) commonly labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or \"ARC\". If another device is already using the ARC port, consider moving that device to a different HDMI port \u2013 only one device can be connected to the ARC port.\n\nIf your TV does not have an ARC port, you can still use a Streambar or soundbar to get exceptional sound from your TV's built-in tuner and other devices connected to your TV, but you will need to connect a second cable. In addition to the HDMI cable, you need to connect an optical cable to your TV's optical output, sometimes labeled \"Digital audio out\" or \"Digital output\". This connection carries TV audio to your Streambar or soundbar, while the HDMI connection delivers video from the streaming player in your Streambar or soundbar to the TV. If you need to use the optical port, visit the settings on your TV to make sure the output is active, or enabled.\n\nNote:\nConsult online documentation or the user manual for your TV if you are not sure your TV has an ARC port or need help finding settings for the optical port.\nWhen using an optical cable, be sure to remove the protective plastic cap from each end of the cable before inserting the connectors. Failing to do so may result in a faulty connection, or damage to the cable or optical port.\nYou do not need to connect an optical cable when using the ARC port.\nDo I need to adjust my TV settings?\n\nIf you are connecting your Streambar or soundbar to the ARC port, it is important you check the settings on your TV since ARC and related features may be disabled by default. If ARC is disabled, the ARC port will behave like a normal HDMI port and you will not hear audio from your TV (and connected devices) on your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nYou should also check the status of a related feature called HDMI-CEC (or just CEC) that helps simplify how you use your", "doc_id": "948e00d7-cb03-4768-93ae-51bfc4507f58", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ac63eaf605418e784af1c0ab882f8e12b9b4331f428e2b8e41862b6a881ce690", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4098}, "relationships": {"1": "cbe5330d-7b84-478c-b902-3c4fe270af93", "3": "68e31eca-9f4b-4de6-8735-e6d5f58a7687"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "68e31eca-9f4b-4de6-8735-e6d5f58a7687": {"__data__": {"text": "port.\nWhen using an optical cable, be sure to remove the protective plastic cap from each end of the cable before inserting the connectors.

If ARC is disabled, the ARC port will behave like a normal HDMI port and you will not hear audio from your TV (and connected devices) on your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nYou should also check the status of a related feature called HDMI-CEC (or just CEC) that helps simplify how you use your entertainment system. CEC allows commands to be shared between devices over the same HDMI connection you use for audio and video, letting you control common features of different devices without having to juggle remotes. If CEC is disabled, you will not be able to use your Streambar or soundbar remote to turn on or off your TV, or your TV remote to control volume on your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nNote: The power button on the remote for your Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar works with most televisions. If your TV is not compatible, continue using your TV remote to turn your television on and off.\n\nWhen you are looking for these settings on your TV, keep in mind that some manufacturers such as Hitachi and Vizio refer to ARC and CEC by their proper names, while others like LG, Panasonic, and Sony use brand-specific trade names. Some manufacturers even combine ARC and CEC into a single setting like Samsung's Anynet+. For help understanding the various trade names, review the detailed article describing how several popular TV brands go about enabling ARC and CEC.\n\nWhere to install your Streambar or soundbar\n\nWhen you install your Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar, it should be centered with the television screen to best anchor the sound to the picture. Whether you choose to simply place it on a piece of furniture in front of your TV, or mount it to the wall or directly to the TV (or TV bracket), avoid installing it where sound may reflect off a nearby flat surface like a TV stand, shelf, or table. Sound reflections like these combine with non-reflecting sound traveling directly from your Streambar or soundbar to negatively affect the sound-quality. The result is an effect known as comb filtering that makes what you hear less crisp and sharp, especially with higher frequencies like dialogue. This \"muddy\" sound can be avoided by installing your Streambar or soundbar using the guidelines below:\n\nMatch the front edges: When placing your Streambar or soundbar on a piece of furniture, the front edge of the device should be flush with the front edge of any TV stand, shelf, or table. If your Streambar or soundbar is set back too far from the front edge of the flat surface, sound will reflect.\nAvoid enclosing your Streambar or soundbar: Avoid placing your Streambar or soundbar inside a closed space like a cabinet or TV stand. If you have no better alternative, make sure the front edge of your Streambar or soundbar is flush with the front edge of the shelf (inside the cabinet or TV stand).\nNo obstructions: The area in front of your Streambar or soundbar should be free of objects such as picture frames, ornaments, plants, etc. High frequencies like dialogue are affected more by these obstructions than low frequencies.\nMount it: If you do not have an ideal location on a piece of furniture, consider mounting your Streambar or soundbar.\nSetup resources\n\nIf you need additional setup help, you can follow along with the appropriate tutorial video, or read one of the quick start guides below.\n\nVideos\n\nQuick start guides\n\nRoku Streambar Pro (model 9101R2)\nRoku Smart Soundbar (model 9101)\nonn. \u2022 Roku Smart Soundbar (model 9100)\nConnect your Streambar or soundbar\n\nAfter you identify the ARC port and make sure ARC and CEC are enabled on your TV, use the steps below to connect your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nUse the", "doc_id": "68e31eca-9f4b-4de6-8735-e6d5f58a7687", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4a733b40af51e3af2c8738eb949db472ac3e43484e225d4dbf4f728b0c59433f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3443, "end": 7605}, "relationships": {"1": "cbe5330d-7b84-478c-b902-3c4fe270af93", "2": "948e00d7-cb03-4768-93ae-51bfc4507f58", "3": "fd0d674c-0bfc-4851-8e1d-7f4562cad4d9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd0d674c-0bfc-4851-8e1d-7f4562cad4d9": {"__data__": {"text": "free of objects such as picture frames, ornaments, plants, etc. High frequencies like dialogue are affected more by these obstructions than low frequencies.\nMount it: If you do not have an ideal location on a piece of furniture, consider mounting your Streambar or soundbar.\nSetup resources\n\nIf you need additional setup help, you can follow along with the appropriate tutorial video, or read one of the quick start guides below.\n\nVideos\n\nQuick start guides\n\nRoku Streambar Pro (model 9101R2)\nRoku Smart Soundbar (model 9101)\nonn. \u2022 Roku Smart Soundbar (model 9100)\nConnect your Streambar or soundbar\n\nAfter you identify the ARC port and make sure ARC and CEC are enabled on your TV, use the steps below to connect your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nUse the included power cable and connect your Streambar or soundbar to a wall outlet, surge protector, or extension cord.\nWith the included Premium High Speed HDMI Cable, connect your Streambar or soundbar to the ARC port on your TV.\n\nNote: If you did not check earlier, make sure ARC and CEC are enabled on your TV.\n\nIf you are not using ARC, use the Premium High Speed HDMI Cable to connect your Streambar or soundbar to any available HDMI port, and connect the included optical cable to the digital audio output on your TV.\n\nAfter the connections are made and your soundbar powers on, make sure the correct input is selected on your TV (the input to which your Streambar or soundbar is connected).

When using the internal streaming player, this is typically indicated on the content itself (e.g., \"5.1\", \"Dolby Digital Plus 5.1\", \"Dolby Surround\". \"Dolby Atmos\"). For external content (e.g., Blu-ray player, TV broadcast) check that your TV's digital audio output is set to Auto (or passthrough) and that the source is configured for surround sound. For more help, contact the manufacturer of the external device, or refer to their online help documentation.\n\nIf the content does not specifically say if it is in surround, then it likely is not. To hear audio from your wireless speakers in these cases, press Star  on your Roku remote during playback and change the Expanded Stereo sound setting to one of the following choices:\n\nMovies and TV: Makes stereo sound feel like surround sound\nMusic: Uses all speakers to fill your room with stereo sound\nOff: Stereo sound only plays from front speakers\nAudio echoes\n\nIf you hear an echo when listening to your Roku wireless speakers, there is likely a delay with the audio from one speaker.

If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network: If your router supports 5GHz, make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz).\nChange the wireless channel: When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\nIf your Roku TV is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still hear an audio playback issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\nMove the router farther away: If your router is close to your Roku TV, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to the TV may cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*A note on terminology:\n\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet.

With your TV remote, you can change TV inputs and launch streaming channels on your TV, and you can also adjust volume, mute sound, and modify audio settings on your soundbar.\n\nIf you are not able to control your soundbar with your Roku TV remote, review the suggestions in this article to help resolve the issue.\n\nWhat should I be able to control on my soundbar?\n\nAfter setting up your Roku TV Ready soundbar, you can use your Roku TV remote to control the following aspects of your soundbar.\n\nVolume and mute: Use the buttons on the side of your Roku TV remote to adjust volume and mute sound. When adjusting volume, you will see a visual \"volume level\" indicator on your Roku TV screen that matches the actual volume level of your soundbar.\nSound modes: While listening to music, watching a movie, or playing a video game, press the Star button  and go to Sound settings where you can select from the various sound modes integrated into your soundbar.\n\nNote: If you prefer, you can use your soundbar remote at any time to adjust volume or change the sound mode. Any changes you make will be reflected in the audio settings menu on your Roku TV. If the manufacturer remote has buttons for controlling power and switching inputs, that functionality is limited to your soundbar and soundbar remote.\n\nWhat should I check first?\n\nBefore you attempt anything else, look for the visual indicator on your TV screen when adjusting volume. If you do not see this, try installing a fresh set of matching batteries in your Roku TV remote and try again.\n\nIf the behavior continues, check that your soundbar is properly connected to the HDMI\u00ae ARC port on your Roku TV, and that you have completed the Roku TV Ready setup process. If your soundbar is not powered on, or has not been set up properly, you cannot control volume, mute, or sound modes on your soundbar.\n\nIs the IR receiver blocked?\n\nWhen you install your Roku TV Ready soundbar, be careful not to block the infrared (IR) receiver on the front of your TV. If the IR receiver is blocked, even partially, it can affect how well you are able to control your TV and soundbar.\n\nWhat is an IR receiver?\n\nYour TV remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to send the signal a short distance from the remote (where an IR transmitter is located) to the front of your Roku TV (where an IR receiver is located). IR receivers are commonly located along the bottom edge of the screen on your TV and are typically part of the bezel. With some models, the IR receiver is offset from the bezel, and may have a shiny surface. Some IR receivers even emit a light when the IR signal is received. If you cannot locate the IR receiver on your TV, refer to the manufacturer's online documentation or contact them directly.\n\nHow do I resolve the issue?\n\nTo operate reliably, your TV remote must be pointed directly at your TV (and the IR receiver) and there must be nothing that can block the signal. Try moving your Roku TV Ready soundbar or Roku TV to a location where the IR receiver is not blocked. Sometimes moving a device only a few inches is enough to correct the behavior.\n\nPro tip: If you cannot easily move your soundbar or TV, you may be able to install an IR repeater system (or kit).

To achieve optimal synchronization of picture and sound when connected to your Roku TV, and reduce the likelihood of momentary audio dropouts, the audio and video signals are slightly delayed when you are using your wireless audio device. In most cases, this is not noticeable. However, when using an interactive device connected to your Roku TV such as an Xbox, PlayStation, or personal computer, you may notice a slight video delay, or what some may refer to as \"video lag\".\n\nTo minimize the video delay on your HDMI or AV input, you can enable Game Mode for that source, improving the video response time.\n\nNote: Game mode cannot be turned on when watching streaming channels or over-the-air TV on the antenna input. If you notice a synchronization issue or other audio problem when using these sources, learn more about resolving general audio playback issues.\n\nHow do I turn Game mode on?\n\nUse the steps below to turn Game mode on (or off) when using an external device connected to your Roku TV.\n\nSwitch to the input on your Roku TV where your game console or computer is connected (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2, AV).\nPress Star  on your Roku TV remote.\nUse the directional pad to scroll up or down and select Picture settings.

To get the best performance, place your speakers strategically in your room using the guidelines in this article. When doing so, remember that every room is unique and affects sound differently. Be sure you experiment with placement to find what sounds best to you.\n\nGeneral considerations\n\nRoku wireless speakers are designed to function in either a stereo configuration with your Roku TV\u2122, or a surround sound configuration with your Roku Streambar\u00ae, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar. When considering possible locations, take a few things into consideration:\n\nAre power outlets nearby? Each speaker has its own power cable that needs to connect to an outlet. If an outlet is not nearby, you may need a separate extension cable.\nAre you mounting your speakers? Decide if you intend to place your speakers in a cabinet or on a piece of furniture, or if you wish to mount them to a wall or attach them to speaker stands (wall mounts and speaker stands not included). If you are mounting your speakers, choose wall mounts or speaker stands that can safely support at least four pounds, and that are compatible with the 1/4\" 20-threaded mounting socket on the back of each speaker.\n\nNote: SANUS\u00ae makes premium wireless speaker swivel mounts and speaker stands that work with Roku wireless speakers.\nAre other objects nearby? Place your speakers away from walls a bit when possible, and not in a confined space such as a tight cabinet. Also, avoid putting other objects in front of your speakers like furniture, photo frames, or books. With less sound bouncing off other surfaces, you hear more sound coming directly at you from the speakers. This helps improve clarity and musical details while reducing \"boomy bass\", or bass that sounds too loud.\nWhat height are your speakers at? Try placing your speakers at ear level (when sitting). If you place the speakers too low, or mount them too high, sound may not seem like it is coming from the actors or objects on the TV screen. If you have no choice but to put them low or high in your room, try aiming the speakers slightly toward your head or ears (when sitting).\n\nOnce you have a general idea where you want to place your speakers, go ahead and set your speakers up even if it means they are not yet in their final location. You will want to use them to listen to music or your favorite movie when experimenting with different speaker locations.\n\nPlacement guidelines with a Roku TV\n\nAfter your wireless speakers are connected to your Roku TV, you can use the guidelines below to help determine the best placement for a stereo configuration.\n\nCreate audio separation: Place one speaker on the left of your Roku TV and the other on the right, spacing them evenly on either side.\n\nThis lets you hear sounds coming from the left and right, rather than a single sound coming directly from your TV.\nMeasure the listening position: For ideal stereo separation, the distance from your listening position to each speaker should closely match the distance between your two speakers. To say it another way, you want to create an equal-sided triangle when looking at the distance between your speakers and the distance from each speaker to your listening position.\nExperiment: Play some music you are familiar with and listen for distinct sound coming from the left and right, but not so much that a noticeable gap is heard in the middle. Move the speakers closer or farther apart until the sound is realistic, and most importantly, you like what you hear.\nPlacement guidelines with a Streambar or Smart Soundbar\n\nBefore you begin evaluating speaker placement, it is best to decide where to install your Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar. Ideally, it should be centered above or below your television screen to anchor dialogue and other critical sounds to characters and objects in the picture. Having your Streambar or Smart Soundbar installed in its final location when auditioning various speaker locations allows you to hear songs and movies as they", "doc_id": "f5f73a44-b909-4488-aec5-9c400c5515a4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7d8a6755783e768e99094571ee7021035164656316fd83bd1b4ee8b77f294078", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4165}, "relationships": {"1": "457706df-1b82-45ba-a41e-99e781ad70e0", "3": "0db5ebb4-ee41-43d5-bb1a-b70aa23fa851"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0db5ebb4-ee41-43d5-bb1a-b70aa23fa851": {"__data__": {"text": "to your listening position.\nExperiment: Play some music you are familiar with and listen for distinct sound coming from the left and right, but not so much that a noticeable gap is heard in the middle.

Try spacing each speaker an even distance from where you sit.\n\nThis lets you hear sounds moving from the left and right behind you, helping to create an immersive surround experience.\nMeasure the listening position: For ideal surround separation, the distance from your listening position to each speaker should closely match the distance between your Streambar or Smart Soundbar and listening position. This helps you to hear sounds from all speakers at the same level regardless of the overall volume.\nExperiment: Watch a few action scenes from a movie or TV show and listen for sound coming from the rear left and right speakers. Move each speaker closer or farther away from where you sit until sounds are distinctly moving between the left and right speakers giving the illusion of movement. Continue experimenting with locations until you like how the surround effects sound.\nFull surround configuration\n\nWith this configuration, referred to as a 5.0 or 5.1 when a Roku subwoofer is connected, four wireless speakers are installed as front left, front right, rear left, and rear right channels, and your Streambar or Smart Soundbar outputs sound for the center channel.\n\nCreate sound separation: In the front of your room, place one speaker to the left of your Streambar or Smart Soundbar, and the other to the right, spacing them evenly on either side. In the rear of your room, place one speaker slightly behind your couch to the left and the other slightly behind your couch to the right. Try spacing each speaker an even distance from where you sit.\n\nThis placement provides a wider sound stage, better separation between channels, and sound moving around your room for a life-like environment.\nMeasure the listening position: For ideal separation, the distance from your listening position to each speaker should closely match the distance between your Streambar or Smart Soundbar and listening position. This helps you to hear sounds from all speakers at the same level regardless of the overall volume.\nExperiment: Watch a few action scenes from a movie or TV show and listen for sound moving between all speakers. Move each speaker closer or farther away from where you sit until sounds are distinctly moving between each speaker creating the illusion of movement. Continue experimenting with various speaker locations until you like how it sounds.\nAlternate locations\n\nWhile the guidelines in this article are intended to help you optimize the audio performance when your Roku wireless speakers are used in traditional stereo and surround configurations, you may wish to use your wireless speakers in another way.

This article provides guidelines and outlines some options for mounting your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nMounting guidelines\n\nWhen choosing a location where to mount your Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar, take the following guidelines into consideration:\n\nDo not block the IR receiver on your TV: Your TV remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to send a signal a short distance to an IR receiver on the front of your TV, typically located along the bottom edge of the screen. Do not mount your Streambar or soundbar in a location that blocks the IR signal from getting to the IR receiver on your TV when seated in your normal viewing position.\nCenter your Streambar or soundbar: To best anchor the sound with the picture, center your Streambar or soundbar with your TV. Mounting it to the left or right of the screen will create a disconnected listening experience.\nInstall at ear level: To best focus the sound at your listening position, your Streambar or soundbar should be mounted at ear level (when you are seated).\nLeave access space: Some TV's have buttons and/or connectors along the bottom or top edge of the screen. When choosing a mounting location, leave enough space between your Streambar or soundbar and TV to allow for access to any control buttons or audio/video connections.\nHow to choose compatible mounting hardware for your Streambar or soundbar\n\nYour Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar features \u00bc\u201d (6.35 mm) 20-threaded mounting sockets for compatibility with a wide range of mounting solutions. These sockets fit standard \u00bc\u201d (6.35 mm) 20-threaded screws, 0.39\u201d (10 mm) in length. These are commonly included with universal mounting kits, or they can typically be purchased from most hardware stores. Any solution you choose must safely support the weight of your Streambar or soundbar. Confirm that your chosen hardware is designed to support a minimum of 5.5 lbs. (2.49 kg).\n\nThe mounting sockets are located on the rear of your Streambar or soundbar, 12.6\" apart as seen below.\n\nWhich soundbar mount is right for me?\n\nManufacturers offer soundbar mounts that let you attach your Streambar or soundbar to the wall, or to your TV. There are a variety of models on the market with a few examples listed below.\n\nMounting to a wall\n\nIf you plan to mount your Streambar or soundbar to a wall, you can purchase an adjustable design such as those listed below.

Turning up the volume may help, but it may annoy others nearby. If you are listening on a Roku\u00ae audio device such as a Roku Streambar\u00ae, Roku Streambar Pro, Roku Smart Soundbar, Roku wireless speakers, or Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, a feature called speech clarity can help you better hear critical dialogue without needing to adjust the volume. Speech clarity works by boosting dialogue separately from background content without increasing the overall loudness of the scene.\n\nBefore you use speech clarity\n\nTo begin using speech clarity, make sure your Roku audio device has been set up successfully. For help, refer to the appropriate article below:\n\nRoku Streambar setup instructions\nRoku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar setup instructions\nRoku wireless speakers setup instructions\nRoku TV Wireless Soundbar setup instructions\nEnable speech clarity during playback\n\nWhen streaming a movie, TV show, music, or Bluetooth\u00ae audio; or when watching content from an external device connected to your Roku TV (e.g., Blu-ray\u2122 player, cable set-top box, game console), you can enable speech clarity from the Options menu as described below.\n\nBegin streaming content, or, to adjust sound settings for a device connected to your Roku TV, switch the active input to this external device.\n\nNote: If you have a Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar and you are watching content from an external device connected to your TV, you cannot adjust sound settings during playback.

You can use the TV remote to switch the active input to whatever device you wish to use, and the sound from that device will automatically play from your audio device.

If another device is already using the ARC (Audio Return Channel) port, consider moving that device to a different HDMI port \u2013 only one device can be connected to the HDMI ARC port. If your TV does not have an HDMI ARC port, you will need to connect a second cable. In addition to the HDMI cable, you need to connect the included optical cable to your TV's optical output, sometimes labeled Digital audio out\u00a0or Digital output. This connection carries TV audio to your Streambar or Smart Soundbar, while the HDMI connection delivers video to the TV.\n\nIf you have a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, can wirelessly pair your soundbar to your Roku TV. There are no messy audio cables to connect or complicated setup.\n\nRefer to the appropriate article below to find your Roku audio device's detailed set up instructions:\n\nHow to set up your Roku Streambar\nHow to set up your Roku Streambar Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar\nHow to set up your Roku TV Wireless Soundbar\nDo I need to adjust my TV settings?\n\nIf you are connecting your Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar to the HDMI ARC port, it is important you check the settings on your TV since ARC and related features may be disabled by default. If ARC is disabled, the HDMI ARC port will behave like a normal HDMI port and you will not hear audio from your TV (and devices connected to the TV) on your Streambar or Smart Soundbar. If you are using a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar, you do not need to change any settings on your TV.\n\nYou should also check the status of a related feature called HDMI-CEC (or just CEC) that helps simplify how you use your entertainment system. CEC allows commands to be shared between devices over the same HDMI connection you use for audio and video, letting you control common features of different devices without having to juggle remotes. If CEC is disabled, you will not be able to use your Streambar or Smart Soundbar remote to turn on or off your TV, or your TV remote to control volume on your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nWhen you are looking for these settings on your TV, keep in mind that some manufacturers such as Hitachi and Vizio refer to ARC and CEC by their proper names, while others like LG, Panasonic, and Sony use brand-specific trade names. Some manufacturers even combine ARC and CEC into a single setting like Samsung's Anynet+. For help understanding the various trade names, review the detailed article describing how several popular TV brands go about enabling ARC and CEC.\n\nHow to connect your other devices\n\nIf your other devices are already connected to your TV, you do not need to change how they are connected to use them with your Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, Roku Smart Soundbar, or Roku TV Wireless Soundbar.

This process typically takes several minutes before you are ready to begin enjoying amazing sound from free \"over-the-air\" broadcast television. If you need help and your Streambar or soundbar is connected to a Roku TV, read the detailed article about setting up the Live TV input. If you have a non-Roku TV, refer to the online documentation for the brand of your television, or contact the manufacturer directly.\n\nGame console, Blu-ray player, cable/satellite box, etc.\n\nThere is nothing particularly unique when setting up these devices. Just connect each device to an available HDMI port or composite audio/video port on your TV, based on the manufacturer's recommendation, and make note of the name of each input (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2, VIDEO 1, AV 3, ...). Once your Streambar or soundbar is connected, you simply need to switch the active input on your TV (using your TV remote) to the name of the input where you connected each device. In just a moment, you will begin hearing the amazing sound from your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nGame console on your Roku TV: If you are setting up a game console on your Roku TV, you can use Automatic Game Console Configuration to achieve optimal gameplay settings with little effort. In addition to supported features being configured automatically, the appearance of the generic input tile you see on your Home screen will be modified with a name and image that matches your game console, making it obvious where to go when you want to play video games.\n\nWhy is there no sound from my other devices?\nIs volume at an audible level? - Use your Roku remote to adjust the volume on your Streambar or soundbar or check that it is not muted.\nAre you using the HDMI ARC port on your TV? - If so, check the TV settings and make sure ARC and related features are enabled. If ARC is not turned on, your TV will not pass audio back to your Streambar or Smart Soundbar.\nIf you are not using an HDMI ARC port, do you have an optical cable connected? - If you are using a standard HDMI port, only video will be transmitted to your TV from your Streambar or Smart Soundbar. You must connect the optical cable to the digital output on your TV to get audio transmitted back to your Streambar or Smart Soundbar.\nLast updated on 3/9/2023, 7:30:18\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "0880238a-37e9-40b9-9ca2-2e07eb64fcbd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3d1deb166495fcf4b532b3f5195e54844beb41204de08515ab6ce33bdcfa68fa", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3271, "end": 6589}, "relationships": {"1": "96121046-0ca3-445f-b5d6-cd9c000ce923", "2": "751d4873-65c5-4b3a-bc88-6d2fd20d0447"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b88a9cf-41d7-45ed-95d0-eafceec66424": {"__data__": {"text": "How to clean your Roku audio device\n\nWhether its a Roku Streambar\u00ae, Roku Streambar Pro, Roku\u00ae Smart Soundbar, a pair of Roku wireless speakers, a Roku TV\u2122 Wireless Soundbar, or Roku subwoofer, every Roku audio device enhances your listening experience, and looks good doing it.

Audio consists of spoken dialogue, music, and sound effects, while video is made up of a sequence of still images that when viewed in rapid succession form a moving picture. If you notice the sound from your Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar does not match the picture on your TV, you have likely encountered something called an audio/video synchronization error, or A/V sync error. One of the more apparent symptoms can occur when you see an actor speaking on screen and notice their lip movement does not match the words coming from their mouth. This type of A/V sync error is often referred to more precisely as a lip-sync error.\n\nThis article explains A/V sync errors in more detail and provides suggestions to correct the behavior.\n\nWhat causes an A/V sync error?\n\nAn A/V sync error occurs when timing of audio and video is not synchronized. To understand why this happens, it is important to remember that audio and video are separate signals that are processed independently. With complex methods applied to varying amounts of data, processing of the two signals is often not completed at the same moment, leading to an intentional delay with either audio or video. While this is typically accounted for using timing information from both signals, there are other factors that can contribute to an A/V sync error, such as:\n\nPoorly authored content: Audio and video are captured separately and must be synchronized before content is distributed. If not properly authored, a movie, TV show, or video game may contain incorrect timing information that leads to an A/V sync error.\nTransmission error: Whether delivered over the internet, a coaxial cable or satellite dish, or on physical media (e.g., Blu-ray\u2122 disc, video game disc), all content must be transmitted to your devices. If data is lost or compromised during this process, incorrect timing information may be acquired when the audio and video signals are processed.\nContent type: Although timing information typically accounts for this, higher resolution video signals such as 4K Ultra HD or HDR (High Dynamic Range) contain significantly more data taking longer to be processed for playback. As a result, the audio signal must be delayed longer after it is processed. If this does not occur, an A/V sync error may result.\nTV settings: Picture settings that affect video processing, or sound settings that convert one audio format to another (also known as audio transcoding) may introduce an A/V sync error or exaggerate one that already exists.\nHow do I fix an A/V sync error?\n\nIf you notice an A/V sync error when using your Streambar or soundbar with your TV and/or connected devices (e.g., game console, Blu-ray player, cable/satellite set-top box), read through the questions below to help narrow the problem.\n\nAre all titles on a channel or device affected?\nWhen you encounter an A/V sync error, stop playback of the movie or TV show and try a different title. If you are playing a video game when you encounter an A/V sync error, try another title on the same game console. If you determine that the sync error is isolated to a single title, it is likely that the movie, TV show, or video game is poorly authored or damaged. With streaming content or content from your cable/satellite provider, try watching the movie or TV show on another channel. With physical media, try cleaning the disc or replacing it with an alternate copy.\n\nIf the A/V sync error affects multiple titles, continue to the next step.\nAre all devices affected?\nIf multiple titles are affected, switch your TV to a different device (from the one where the A/V sync error was discovered) and play a movie, TV show, or video game on the new device. If you discover that the sync error only occurs on the original device, try restarting that device.\n\nIf the A/V sync error occurs with multiple titles on a single streaming", "doc_id": "0b98b6a8-5758-4f0e-8f30-80658ef4f962", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cad261357d0fe54b0cd33f6129666e05c8fde4366e8d5f186a8de07342c43afd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4153}, "relationships": {"1": "61090a3c-5364-4677-8900-8825e4f4a84e", "3": "33119435-4889-46c6-a54c-f9245ce0837f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "33119435-4889-46c6-a54c-f9245ce0837f": {"__data__": {"text": "you determine that the sync error is isolated to a single title, it is likely that the movie, TV show, or video game is poorly authored or damaged.

Whether you simply place your Streambar or soundbar on a piece of furniture in front of your TV, or mount it to the wall or directly to the TV (or bracket), be careful not to block the infrared (IR) receiver on the front of your TV. If the IR receiver is blocked, even partially, it can affect how well you are able to control your TV.\n\nThis article will help you fix the problem if you can no longer control your TV after installing your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nWhat is an IR receiver?\n\nYour TV remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to send the signal a short distance from the remote (where an IR transmitter is located) to the front of your TV (where an IR receiver is located). IR receivers are commonly located along the bottom edge of the screen on your TV and are typically part of the bezel. With some models, the IR receiver is offset from the bezel, and may have a shiny surface. Some IR receivers even emit a light when the IR signal is received. If you cannot locate the IR receiver on your TV, refer to the manufacturer's online documentation, or contact them directly.\n\nHow do I fix the problem?\n\nTo operate reliably, your TV remote must be pointed directly at your TV (and the IR receiver) and there must be nothing that can block the signal. Try moving your Streambar or soundbar, or your TV to a location where the IR receiver is not blocked. Sometimes moving a device only a few inches is enough to correct the behavior.\n\nPro tip: If you cannot easily move your Streambar or soundbar, or your TV, you may be able to install an IR repeater system (or kit). This type of system includes three components - an IR receiver you typically attach somewhere on your TV (where it will not be blocked), a main hub or \"brain\" unit that the IR receiver connects to, and an IR transmitter that relays the signal to the blocked IR receiver built into your TV. You can purchase an IR repeater system from an online retailer, or your local electronics store. This suggestion is provided if you are comfortable working with audio/video equipment. For more help, contact a local audio/video installation shop.\n\nLast updated on 3/11/2022, 4:40:13\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "9dc7a973-a1e8-49ae-bd28-702ebffb53ab", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7e57eaea7ab7b6fe97353d89550484b410fbdbe751b3895c86e0d9872e62a94d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2461}, "relationships": {"1": "6df614dd-ce74-4056-9078-927485172fa3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab8494f0-72d5-4c66-92bf-a84dc86c48f5": {"__data__": {"text": "How to set up your Roku\u00ae Streambar\u00ae Pro or Roku Smart Soundbar with a Roku TV\u2122\n\nThis portion of the setup article applies only to your Roku Streambar Pro, Roku Smart Soundbar, or onn.\u2122 \u2022 Roku Smart Soundbar if it is connected to a compatible Roku TV.

This single connection transmits both video from your Streambar or soundbar to your TV, and audio from your TV and connected devices (Blu-ray\u2122 player, game console) to your Streambar or soundbar. If you do not use the HDMI port labeled ARC, you need to connect the included optical cable to get audio from your TV and connected devices to your Streambar or soundbar.\n\nNote: When using an optical cable, be sure to remove the protective plastic cap from each end of the cable before inserting the connectors. Failing to do so may result in a faulty connection, or damage to the cable or optical port.\n\nIs ARC and CEC enabled on your TV? - It is important you check the settings on your TV since CEC and ARC may be disabled by default.

When choosing a wall mount, you should consider where your TV will be displayed, what features you are interested in, and the best way to safely mount your TV. After mounting your TV, consider expanding your entertainment experience by connecting a Roku TV\u2122 Wireless Soundbar or creating a surround sound system.\n\nThis article will help you choose a safe and compatible wall mount for your Roku-branded TV or Roku TV\u00a0model. The weight, VESA\u2122 pattern, screw size, and dimensions are provided for Select and Plus Series TVs made by Roku\u00ae. If your Roku TV model is made by any other manufacturer, contact them directly for mounting specifications.\n\nTypes of wall mounts\n\nMost wall mounts fit into one of three categories based on their features: fixed mount, tilting mount, or full motion mount. See the details below to help determine which wall mount is best for your situation.\n\nFixed Mount\n\nFixed mounts are the simplest type of mount and also tend to be the least expensive. With a fixed mount, your TV is mounted on the wall in a static position and cannot be moved or adjusted. This type of mount uses a minimal amount of space, since it stays flush to the wall.\n\nTilting Mount\n\nTilting mounts allow you to tilt the angle of your TV for better viewing. These mounts tend to be used in situations where your TV is mounted above eye level, such as over a fireplace.\n\nFull Motion Mount\n\nFull motion mounts offer both tilt and swivel adjustment, which allows you to get the perfect viewing angle in many different situations. You can swivel to cut out glare from a window and tilt to view a TV mounted above eye level. These mounts tend to be the more expensive because of the complex engineering to support the different motion.\n\nHow to choose a wall mount\n\nWhen choosing a wall mount for your TV, you should consider both the compatibility and safety factors of the mount.\n\nWall mount compatibility\n\nAll Roku-branded TVs support a standard VESA pattern, but there several different VESA sizes. Learn more about the VESA standard at https://vesa.org.\n\nConsider the following when looking for a compatible mount:\n\nChoose a VESA wall mount. Choose a mount that matches the specific VESA pattern of your TV.\nCheck the weight rating. Choose a wall mount that is rated to handle the weight of the TV.\nUse the right hardware. Ensure the wall mount comes with screws that are the right size and depth for your TV, or purchase these items separately.\nChoose a safety certified mount. Choose a mount certified by an independent laboratory, such as UL\u00ae, CS, or ETL\u00ae.\nUsing an existing wall mount\n\nIf you are replacing an old TV with a new Roku-branded TV, you may already have an existing wall mount. If your existing mount follows VESA standards and is rated for the size and weight of your new TV, you may be able to reuse it as is. Check the specifications of your wall mount and new Roku-branded TV to ensure compatibility.\n\nNote: Some mounts may require the addition of standoffs to seat properly behind your Roku-branded TV. These parts are typically included along with extra screws in your wall mount kit, but you may need to purchase additional parts.\nWall mount installation tips\n\nWhen you are ready to mount your TV, there are several things to consider during installation to get the best results.\n\nReview the following best practice and safety tips for wall mount installation:\n\nGet help with installation. Use two people to safely wall mount the TV or contact a professional TV mounting service for assistance.\nFollow instructions. Follow all mounting instructions provided by the manufacturer or supplier of your wall mount.\nUse a level. Verify your wall is vertical and use a level while mounting.\nMount to a sturdy surface.

You may be able to adjust the range of IP addresses assigned to wired and wireless devices by your router*, but if you are not comfortable configuring network equipment, you should consult a local professional for help.\nHave you checked the network names closely? Many Wi-Fi routers today use two signals to provide better speed and coverage. These devices are generally referred to as dual-band routers because they transmit data at the lower 2.4 GHz band and the higher 5 GHz band. When connecting devices to your wireless network, choices may include more than one network with a similar name. For example, you may see something like MyNetwork_2.4GHz and MyNetwork_5GHz. Confirm that your Roku device and your phone or tablet are connected to the same band and network name.\nIs your Roku device using a public IP address? Devices on your network, such as your Roku device, should be using a private IP address that falls within one of the following ranges:\n\n\n\u00a0Start\u00a0\t\u00a0End\u00a0\n\u00a010.0.0.0\u00a0\t\u00a010.255.255.255\u00a0\n\u00a0172.16.0.0\u00a0\t\u00a0173.32.255.255\u00a0\n\u00a0192.168.0.0\u00a0\t\u00a0192.168.255.255\u00a0\n\nYou can find the IP address of your Roku device by going to Settings > Network > About. If the IP address is not within one of these private ranges, your Roku device is using a public IP address which is most common when a router is not present on your network. Install a router to manage IP addresses or contact your internet service provider (ISP) or the person who manages your network to help resolve the problem.\nIs Access Point (AP) isolation enabled on your network? AP isolation prevents devices from communicating on a Wi-Fi network. Refer to documentation for your router to learn how to check and disable this setting or contact the person who manages your network for help.\nAdditional troubleshooting steps\n\nIf the troubleshooting tips above did not help and your device still does not appear on the discovery screen, try the following suggestions.\n\nRestart your Roku device.

This is a simple process, but its important to understand a few things before you begin. This article provides more details about each surround sound connection, and explains how you can get the best performance with your Roku TV.\n\nSurround sound connections on your Roku TV\n\nWhen you connect your AVR or soundbar to your Roku TV, the type of connection you choose mainly depends on the available hardware connections and features of your AVR or soundbar. Some older audio devices may be incompatible with newer HDMI technologies, or may be limited to older optical audio connections. Use the descriptions below to determine what type of connections are available on your surround sound system. All Roku TV models have a type of HDMI ARC connection and a digital audio output.\n\nDigital audio output\n\nThis connection is typically labeled \"Digital audio out\" or \"Digital output\", and is sometimes referred to as S/PDIF or optical. To make the connection, you will use an optical cable, sometimes called a TOSLINK cable.\n\nNote: When using an optical cable, be sure to remove the protective plastic cap from each end of the cable before inserting the connectors. Failing to do so may result in a faulty connection, or damage to the cable or optical port.\nHDMI ARC\n\nThe HDMI ARC (or Audio Return Channel) connection is located among the other HDMI ports, and is often labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or just \"ARC\". When connecting your surround sound system using ARC, you will use an HDMI cable.\n\nHDMI eARC (select Roku TV models only)\n\nThe HDMI eARC (or Enhanced Audio Return Channel) connection is located with the other HDMI ports, and is commonly labeled \"HDMI eARC\" or simply \"eARC\". To take advantage of eARC, you need to use a High Speed HDMI Cable with support for Ethernet.\n\nNote: HDMI eARC is only available on select Roku TV models.\n\nIf you are setting up a 4K Ultra HD or HDR device with your compatible Roku TV, you need to use a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable to get a 4K Ultra HD or HDR image when using ARC. For eARC, you need a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet, or an Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable (which does include Ethernet support).\n\nIf you are setting up an 8K Ultra HD or HDR device with your compatible Roku TV, you need to use an Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable to get an 8K Ultra HD or HDR image when using ARC or eARC.\n\nBenefits of HDMI ARC\n\nThe HDMI ARC connection provides a number of benefits over the digital audio output, including those described below.\n\nLess clutter - With a single cable, HDMI ARC uses two-way communication to send sound to your AVR or soundbar, while simultaneously sending picture to your Roku TV. There is no need for separate audio and video cables.\nControl other devices - Using only your Roku TV remote, you can control aspects of your home theater like adjusting the volume and muting the sound.\nSupport for more surround sound formats - The HDMI ARC connection supports the same formats as the digital audio output, but with greater throughput, it also supports advanced formats like Dolby Digital Plus\u2122 and Dolby Atmos\u00ae. The S/PDIF connection is limited to 2 channels of uncompressed stereo sound (PCM), or 5.1 channels of compressed surround sound (Dolby Digital\u2122 or DTS\u00ae).\nHDMI eARC advancements\n\nWith significantly greater throughput, HDMI eARC offers support for advanced surround sound formats with higher audio quality. In addition to the formats S/PDIF and ARC support, the newer eARC connection adds support for full-resolution uncompressed audio formats like DTS-HD Master Audio\u2122, DTS:X\u00ae, Dolby\u00ae TrueHD, and Dolby Atmos.\n\nNote: Dolby Atmos is supported on ARC, but only in a compressed format.

HDMI eARC supports Dolby Atmos in a higher quality uncompressed format.\n\nWith faster data transfer and increased bandwidth, eARC also has built-in audio and video \"lip-sync\", which was an optional feature in the original ARC specification.\n\nTo take advantage of these advancements, both your Roku TV and AVR or soundbar must have an eARC connection. If one of your devices does not support eARC, you can still use HDMI ARC, but the device that supports eARC will not be able to use any of the enhanced features.\n\nNote: HDMI eARC is only available on select Roku TV models.\n\nAs mentioned above, you also need to make the connection using a High Speed HDMI Cable with support for Ethernet, like an Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable.\n\nWhat to check before using ARC or eARC\n\nBefore you connect your surround sound system using ARC or eARC, you should check to make sure HDMI ARC (or eARC) is enabled along with an HDMI feature called CEC (or Consumer Electronics Control). With CEC enabled, you can use your Roku TV remote to adjust the volume and mute the sound of your home theater, and display the volume level and mute status on the TV screen. You can find these settings on your Roku TV using the instructions below. If you need help finding the CEC and ARC settings on your AVR or soundbar, visit the manufacturer's online resources or contact them directly.\n\nTo enable ARC (or eARC):\n\nPress Home  on your Roku TV remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Control other devices (CEC)\nScroll and highlight ARC (or eARC)\nCheck the box using OK  on your remote to enable ARC (or eARC)\n\nTo enable CEC:\n\nPerform ARC steps 1 through 4 above\nScroll and highlight System audio control\nCheck the box to enable System audio control\nHighlight 1-touch play\nCheck the box to enable 1-touch play\n\nIf you want to learn more, refer to the detailed article about enabling CEC and ARC on your TV.\n\nHow to adjust surround sound settings on your Roku TV\n\nYou can configure various surround sound settings on your Roku TV in the S/PDIF and ARC menu using the instructions below.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku TV remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Audio\nSelect S/PDIF and ARC and make a selection\n\nAuto detect - This is the default setting that allows your Roku TV to automatically detect the capabilities of your surround sound system over the HDMI connection.\n\nAuto passthrough - Delivers unmodified Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, or DTS audio when available with the movie or TV show and when your Roku TV detects that your surround sound system supports the audio format.\n\nNote: The Auto passthrough setting allows an AVR or soundbar with appropriate capabilities to play content without any delay due to processing in the TV. When Auto passthrough is enabled, audio formats that are not supported by the AVR or soundbar may be converted to stereo sound (PCM) to keep any processing delay to a minimum.\n\nSpecific audio formats - Choose one of the specific audio formats if the audio capabilities of your AVR or soundbar is not detected correctly, and you know it supports the specific audio format(s).\n\nLast updated on 12/30/2022, 2:47:48\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "2ba8beab-327e-49c0-9b03-79c1702800a9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "44272425f32e390791a559f593c0b9da8eb37f2944de9e851eef2d873d22ffb4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3226, "end": 7076}, "relationships": {"1": "50dcbbd2-e085-4ee1-8c7a-d6a2df94da8b", "2": "f28aa782-bf58-48ac-b16e-b54f064710fe"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cab0bd7-5b78-4a3f-88a5-e98c460ff54f": {"__data__": {"text": "How to set up your Roku Express 4K+\n\nRoku\u00ae Express 4K+ (model 3941) is a premium streaming player designed to deliver an exceptional viewing experience, and ships with a Roku voice remote with TV power, volume, and mute buttons.

With select game consoles, your Roku TV will automatically configure specific settings for you, letting you jump right into the fun without needing to do much to get your favorite games looking their best.\n\nIn this article, you will learn more about Automatic Game Console Configuration and features that affect gameplay and see how to adjust settings on your own.\n\nWhat does Automatic Game Console Configuration do?\n\nWhen a supported game console is connected to an HDMI\u00ae port on your Roku TV, the appearance of the generic input tile you see on your Home screen is modified with a custom name and image that matches your game console, making it obvious where to go when you want to play video games.\n\nAdditionally, your Roku TV detects the capabilities of your game console and configures supported features automatically. As you continue reading about various features, look for notes that list specific game consoles that support each feature.\n\nHow to reduce input lag on your Roku TV\n\nWhen playing video games, the primary issue you may encounter is something called input lag, or display lag, which refers to the delay between an input (like when you press a button on your video game controller) to when an action for that input is seen on your TV screen (like when a game character reacts). This delay is not typically an issue when watching a movie or TV show, but with video games, especially those with fast-moving action like a first-person shooter, it is particularly important to have lower input lag for a more responsive and enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nTo help reduce input lag, all Roku TV models support a low-latency setting called Game mode. When Game mode is turned on, video processing elements such as noise reduction, de-interlacing, and motion smoothing are turned off to optimize TV performance for video game play. Game mode can be enabled or disabled individually for each HDMI or A/V port.\n\n\tWhen a game console that supports Game mode (e.g., Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 360) is detected on an HDMI port, Game mode is enabled automatically. You will see an on-screen message the first time the feature is enabled allowing you to decline the automatic change and keep Game mode disabled. Game mode is not enabled automatically for game consoles that support ALLM, such as the Xbox One and Xbox Series X.\n\nYou can easily adjust the Game mode setting at any time using the instructions below.\n\nSwitch to the port on your Roku TV where your game console is connected (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2, AV)\nPress Star  on your Roku TV remote\nUse the directional pad to scroll up or down and select Picture settings. The directional pad is plus-shaped and is in the center of your Roku remote\nScroll and highlight Game mode\nPress left or right to turn Game mode On (or Off)\n\nIMPORTANT: Input lag can be influenced by other factors not limited to settings on your Roku TV. You should also check the network connection speed, display output resolution, and frame rate of your game console, and optimize these settings for the best gaming experience. If you need help, visit the online resources for the manufacturer of your game console, or contact them directly.\n\nAdvanced features (available on select Roku TV models)\n\nIn addition to Game mode, select Roku TV models support advanced features that enhance usability and picture quality for game consoles connected via HDMI. These include HDR gaming, Auto Low-Latency Mode, Variable Refresh Rate and FreeSync\u2122, High Frame Rate, and THX Certified Game Mode.\n\nHDR gaming\n\nWith a wide range of virtual environments, dynamic animations, and dramatic shifts in perspective, video games are great for showing off the sharper picture clarity of 4K Ultra HD (4K) and the expanded contrast and color range of High Dynamic Range (HDR). If your Roku TV supports 4K (with the exception of model numbers starting with '6'), you can enjoy enhanced picture quality with built-in HDR picture modes compatible with HDR game consoles.\n\nNote: To find the model of your Roku TV, go to the Home screen and select Settings > System > About.\n\nTo take advantage of", "doc_id": "07fad018-b2c1-40a5-b590-0485338e1a5d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1a0b90789e08ab84694b083bc4120b1390b1ea11711b6cfb799fad0974110e17", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4354}, "relationships": {"1": "4d1d8d75-7f8a-4cd6-b2d0-4749b00fb1c0", "3": "d9db98cb-ef1d-4f69-a8ab-f2729a839b5a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9db98cb-ef1d-4f69-a8ab-f2729a839b5a": {"__data__": {"text": "picture quality for game consoles connected via HDMI.

A momentary notification, \"Switching to Game mode\", appears on the TV screen for each ALLM transition.\n\nNote: When ALLM is active, the manual Game mode setting in the Options menu is not available.\n\nTo use ALLM, both your game console and your Roku TV must support HDMI 2.0 or higher and ALLM must be enabled. ALLM is supported on all Roku TV models that support 4K except model numbers starting with '6'. For help enabling ALLM on your game console, refer to online resources for the manufacturer.\n\n\tWhen a game console that supports ALLM is detected (e.g., Xbox One, Xbox Series X), the individual HDMI port (where your game console is connected) on your compatible Roku TV is automatically configured to Standard and ALLM is enabled.\nVariable Refresh Rate and FreeSync\n\nAnother advanced feature supported on certain game consoles and titles is called variable refresh rate, or VRR. When enabled, VRR helps eliminate input latency, screen tearing, and stuttering that sometimes appears in highly complex, fast-moving games. Some Roku TV models support FreeSync which is a technology certified by AMD. Roku TV models that support 8K Ultra HD are FreeSync Premium certified for serious gamers.\n\nTo take advantage of VRR or FreeSync, you must enable the feature on both your game console and your compatible Roku TV.\n\n\tWhen a game console that supports VRR is detected (e.g., Xbox One, Xbox Series X), the individual HDMI port (where your game console is connected) on your compatible Roku TV is automatically configured to Standard and VRR is enabled. When FreeSync is detected, the HDMI port is configured for Standard and FreeSync is enabled.\n\nYou can use the instructions below to adjust the VRR or FreeSync setting on your Roku TV.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku TV remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect TV inputs\nChoose the specific HDMI port where your game console is connected\nSelect Variable refresh rate or FreeSync variable refresh rate to turn the feature on (or off)\n\nNote: If you do not see a \"Variable refresh rate\" or \"FreeSync variable refresh rate\" option, your Roku TV does not support this advanced feature.\n\nWith VRR, your Roku TV can display Full HD (1080p) at variable frame rates between 48 and 120fps and 4K at variable frame rates between 48 and 60fps.

For an optimized gaming experience, set the resolution of your game console to 1080p at 120fps. For help, visit the online resources for the manufacturer, or contact them directly.\n\nWith FreeSync, your compatible Roku TV can display 4K at variable frame rates between 48 and 120fps. FreeSync is only supported on an 8K Roku TV on HDMI ports 1 and 2 which support HDMI 2.1. HDMI ports 3 and 4 support HDMI 2.0 and traditional VRR.\n\nHigh Frame Rate\n\nHigh Frame Rate (or HFR) is an advanced feature that provides a smoother image with reduced lag and greater detail. It is beneficial if you participate in competitive multiplayer tournaments or prefer extra responsiveness in your single-player games. Select Roku TV models support high frame rates up to 120fps at Full HD (1080p), Quad HD (1440p), and 4K on select HDMI ports. To check the HFR support on your model, refer to the in-box manual, or contact the manufacturer of your Roku TV.\n\nTo play games with HFR, both your game console and Roku TV must support HDMI 2.0 or higher. Your compatible Roku TV communicates automatically over HDMI with your game console to display the available frame rates. If your game console uses HFR, your compatible Roku TV will detect this and display higher frame rates automatically. There is no need to configure a manual setting on your Roku TV to use HFR.\n\n\tWhen a game console that supports HFR is detected (e.g., PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X), the individual HDMI port (where your game console is connected) on your compatible Roku TV is automatically configured to Standard.\nTHX Certified Game Mode\n\nWhen enabled, THX Certified Game Mode assures you that game play appears as the game creator intended providing vivid colors, crisp details, and better contrast, all while maintaining fast response times. THX Game Mode is available on select Roku TV models as a dedicated \"Gaming\" picture mode available in the Picture settings menu. To determine if your Roku TV supports THX Game Mode, look for the \"Gaming\" setting under Picture mode for any HDMI port. Be careful as this is not to be confused with \"Game Mode\" which is available in older Roku TV models.\n\nWhen the \"Gaming\" picture mode is enabled, your Roku TV automatically enables the standard Game mode setting. As a result, the manual Game mode setting in the Options menu is not available when THX Game Mode is turned on.\n\n\tWhen a game console that supports THX Game Mode is detected (e.g., Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X), your Roku TV automatically enables the \"Gaming\" picture mode on the individual HDMI port (where your game console is connected).\nLast updated on 12/30/2022, 2:54:08\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "22d70f79-28d5-46f1-999a-d6c660100aae", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1584458b3f8db39d67c778474d1f576bf2ec7e333ab4318ad558a15f92902e19", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7623, "end": 11128}, "relationships": {"1": "4d1d8d75-7f8a-4cd6-b2d0-4749b00fb1c0", "2": "d9db98cb-ef1d-4f69-a8ab-f2729a839b5a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "950a5c39-3e21-4252-859b-05a3fb57302c": {"__data__": {"text": "How to add a Roku\u00ae streaming device to your Roku account\n\nWhen you activate a Roku streaming player or Roku TV\u2122, you have the choice to add, or link it to your existing Roku account, or you can create a new account.

Among the sources you may want to connect are devices that produce a 4K (4K Ultra HD) or 8K (8K Ultra HD) image with greater detail such as an Xbox, PlayStation, or Ultra HD Blu-ray player. Many of these devices also output the 4K or 8K video signal in HDR (High Dynamic Range) with more vibrant, rich colors and improved contrast.\n\nA 4K or 8K device will work with any Roku TV. However, you cannot watch movies or play video games in 4K or 8K without a Roku TV that supports 4K or 8K resolutions. Similarly, you will not see an HDR image from your 4K or 8K device without a Roku TV that also supports HDR.

When playing content from an app on a game console, look for titles displaying an HDR logo.\n\n4K or 8K Roku TV capable of displaying HDR content with an available HDMI input that is configured correctly (see below)\nAppropriate HDMI cable (see above)\nWhat is HDMI\u00ae?\n\nHDMI, or High-Definition Multimedia Interface\u00ae is the digital standard for connecting consumer video and audio equipment. With a single cable, HDMI can deliver both the audio and video signals.\n\nWhile the physical connectors remain unchanged, the HDMI standard continues to evolve as technology advances. Each version increases the audio and video capabilities, while maintaining support for advancements made in previous versions. More features mean increased manufacturing requirements, and as a result, HDMI cables designed for earlier standards may not support the latest enhancements. Today, most devices take advantage of the elements of version 1.4 or version 2.0, with some newer devices also supporting elements of version 2.1.\n\n\t\n\nDifferences between HDMI versions\n\nAlready having support for high definition (HD) resolutions such as 720p, 1080i, and 1080p, the HDMI standard evolved when version 1.4 added support for basic 4K video. Following this advancement, the available bandwidth increased significantly for version 2.0 allowing it to improve upon 4K support with higher frame rates, more color information, and support for HDR content. With version 2.1, the bandwidth increased again providing support for even higher frame rates, 8K video, and several advanced features.\n\nWhen playing video, what you see is a quick succession of still images, or frames, which creates the illusion of motion or animation. The number of frames displayed each second is known as the frame rate and is measured in frames per second (fps), which some manufacturers may refer to as frequency (Hz). The higher the frame rate, the smoother the motion appears. HDMI 1.4 supports 4K video at a maximum frame rate of 30fps while HDMI 2.0 adds support for higher refresh rates like 50fps and 60fps, and HDMI 2.1 adds support for 4K video up to 120fps and 8K video up to 60fps.\n\nDevices that are only able to output HD resolutions such as cable or satellite boxes, generally only support elements of HDMI 1.4, while devices that output 4K,", "doc_id": "53dfac46-d8ba-44e2-867e-8141e9e0b85a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "637ae6d29d8b7e0c40b9f868c447e7e2492ae757d74f0910f3393e2346b3ca03", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3922}, "relationships": {"1": "dc889614-4b2a-49b5-8893-7b4ca18fc739", "3": "649d8589-d407-4dd0-a9e7-6948706e02e9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "649d8589-d407-4dd0-a9e7-6948706e02e9": {"__data__": {"text": "video, and several advanced features.\n\nWhen playing video, what you see is a quick succession of still images, or frames, which creates the illusion of motion or animation.

You can see more requirements in the detailed articles about setting up your Roku player for 4K or setting up your Roku player for HDR.\n\nIf your Roku Streaming Stick 4K will not fit in your TV's HDMI port due to space restrictions, then you may wish to get a free HDMI extender cable.\n\nWhat is the long-range Wi-Fi\u00ae receiver?\n\nThe long-range Wi-Fi receiver is part of the USB power cable that must be attached to your Roku Streaming Stick 4K. It allows your Streaming Stick to connect to your wireless network and the internet so you can stream movies, TV shows and more. The Wi-Fi receiver is designed to reduce wireless interference providing a faster and more reliable connection. Power is provided to your Streaming Stick by connecting the USB power cable to the USB port on your TV, or preferably, a wall outlet (when used with the power adaptor).\n\nHow to connect your Streaming Stick\n\nUse the diagrams below as a guide to help connect your Roku Streaming Stick 4K. Make sure all connections are secure and firmly attached.\n\nTo get started, connect your Roku Streaming Stick 4K to an available HDMI port on your TV. If you plan to stream movies and TV shows in 4K or HDR, remember to select an HDMI 2.0 port that supports HDCP 2.2. Learn what to look for when trying to identify an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2.\n\nIf your Streaming Stick will not easily connect to the HDMI port on your TV due to space restrictions, then you may wish to get a free HDMI extender cable.\n\nNext, plug the USB power cable into a suitable power source \u2013 either the USB port on your TV, or preferably, a wall outlet (when used with the power adaptor).\n\nNote: The USB port on some TV\u2019s may be unable to power a Streaming Stick. If you see the on-screen warning message that appears in these cases, use a wall outlet.\n\nFinally, attach the Wi-Fi receiver firmly to the Roku Streaming Stick 4K. A poor connection will prevent your Streaming Stick from connecting to your wireless network and ultimately the internet. If you recently moved your Streaming Stick from another HDMI input, or another TV altogether, make sure to check that all connections are secure before use.\n\nSetting up your Streaming Stick\nReview the Quick Start Guide below, or follow along with the tutorial video:\n\n\n Roku Streaming Stick 4K (model 3820)\n\nUse your TV remote to power on your television and select the input where you connected your Streaming Stick.

However, you will not be able to take advantage of 4K resolution, or Dolby Vision\u2122, HDR10+, and similar HDR formats without a compatible TV. You can see more requirements in the detailed articles about setting up your Roku player for 4K or setting up your Roku player for HDR.\n\nIf your Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ will not fit in your TV's HDMI port due to space restrictions, then you may wish to get a free HDMI extender cable.\n\nWhat is the long-range Wi-Fi\u00ae receiver?\n\nThe long-range Wi-Fi receiver is part of the USB power cable that must be attached to your Roku Streaming Stick 4K+. It allows your Streaming Stick to connect to your wireless network and the internet so you can stream movies, TV shows and more. The Wi-Fi receiver is designed to reduce wireless interference providing a faster and more reliable connection. Power is provided to your Streaming Stick by connecting the USB power cable to the USB port on your TV, or preferably, a wall outlet (when used with the power adaptor).\n\nHow to connect your Streaming Stick\n\nUse the diagrams below as a guide to help connect your Roku Streaming Stick 4K+. Make sure all connections are secure and firmly attached.\n\n\n\nTo get started, connect your Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ to an available HDMI port on your TV. If you plan to stream movies and TV shows in 4K or HDR, remember to select an HDMI 2.0 port that supports HDCP 2.2. Learn what to look for when trying to identify an HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2.\n\nIf your Streaming Stick will not easily connect to the HDMI port on your TV due to space restrictions, then you may wish to get a free HDMI extender cable.\n\nNext, plug the USB power cable into a suitable power source \u2013 either the USB port on your TV, or preferably, a wall outlet (when used with the power adaptor).\n\nNote: The USB port on some TV\u2019s may be unable to power a Streaming Stick. If you see the on-screen warning message that appears in these cases, use a wall outlet.\n\nFinally, attach the Wi-Fi receiver firmly to the Roku Streaming Stick 4K+. A poor connection will prevent your Streaming Stick from connecting to your wireless network and ultimately the internet. If you recently moved your Streaming Stick from another HDMI input, or another TV altogether, make sure to check that all connections are secure before use.\n\nSetting up your Streaming Stick\nReview the Quick Start Guide below, or follow along with the tutorial video:\n\n Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ (model 3821)\n\nUse your TV remote to power on your television and select the input where you connected your Streaming Stick.

Your Roku\u00ae streaming player can be configured to always detect the best resolution and frame rate of your TV, or you can choose to manually select the resolution and frame rate, known together as display type. Roku players that support High Dynamic Range (HDR) ship with an HDMI 2.0 compatible cable. If you cannot use the included cable, be sure to purchase a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable.\n\nWhat is resolution and frame rate?\n\nResolution is the measure of how much detail you can see on the screen. Typical resolutions on TVs today are 720p, 1080p and 4K Ultra HD (4K), with some 4K TVs also supporting higher frame rates and more color information with High Dynamic Range (HDR). The higher the resolution, the sharper and more realistic the image appears.\n\nWhen playing video, what you see is a quick succession of still images, or frames, which creates the illusion of motion or animation. The number of frames displayed each second is known as the frame rate and is measured in frames per second (fps), or frequency (Hz). The higher the frame rate, the smoother the motion appears.\n\nHow to configure your player to detect the best resolution and frame rate\n\nDuring setup, your Roku streaming player will analyze the HDMI\u00ae connection to determine the resolutions and frame rates supported by your TV. If your streaming player can determine the best configuration for your TV, the guided setup process will automatically select the best settings, so you do not have to manually configure the settings. The automatic setting is appropriate for most situations.\n\nHow to change the display type\n\nIf your Roku streaming player is unable to correctly detect the capabilities of your TV, you may wish to configure the display type on your own. Follow the steps below to manually change your display type setting.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect Display type\nSelect one of the available display types and press OK  on your remote\nYour screen may go black for a few seconds while the display setting is changed\n\n\n\n\nWhen an image is shown, select Yes, I can see it and press OK on your remote\n\n\n\n\nYour screen will return to the Display type menu\nA check  will appear next to the new display setting\nNote: If you receive a message indicating your TV does not support a display type, you can still select the display type and try it anyway.\n\nWhat to do if there is no picture after changing the display type\n\nIf you do not see a picture after choosing the new setting, your TV does not support the resolution or frame rate. Your streaming player will revert to the previous setting after 20 seconds. If you believe your TV supports the desired display type, but you continue to see no picture, review the setup requirements for 4K or the setup requirements for HDR..\n\nA note on HDMI cables\n\nRoku players that support HDR ship with an HDMI 2.0 compatible cable. If you cannot use the included cable, be sure to purchase a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable. The typically more expensive Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is a good choice for reducing potential Wi-Fi\u00ae and Bluetooth\u00ae interference, or for future-proofing an installation where the cable location is in an otherwise inaccessible area. Cables that are not labeled or may be labeled \"high speed\" or \"standard speed\" may not be adequate for 4K HDR10, HDR10+, or Dolby Vision content at 60fps.\n\nIf your Roku player is connected to an AVR or soundbar, make sure all cables are HDMI 2.0 compatible. If you see a black screen or poor performance and video degradation with a 4K HDR signal, replace any older cables with a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy is the image not in HDR or the picture quality poor when watching HDR content?\n\nWhen you specifically watch an HDR movie or TV show on your HDR-capable Roku device, you may notice the image is not displayed in HDR, or the picture quality is poor.

If you prefer, your Roku player can be configured to output the native format of each movie, video or TV show by enabling the auto-adjust display refresh rate setting, if available.\n\nNote: The auto-adjust display refresh rate setting may not be applicable to content from certain channels.\nWhat is display refresh rate?\n\nWhen playing video, \u201cfps\u201d refers to frames per second, also known as frame rate, or display refresh rate. Each frame is a still image; displaying frames in quick succession creates the illusion of motion or animation. The more frames per second, the smoother the motion appears.\n\nWhat is native format?\n\nHollywood movies are commonly filmed at 24fps, movies and videos produced in Europe are often shot at 25fps, and TV shows are filmed at 30fps or 60fps in the United States, and 25fps or 50fps in Europe. These various display rates are specific to each type of content and are known as the native format.\n\nHow to configure the display refresh rate\n\nThe auto-adjust display refresh rate setting can be enabled or disabled from the Settings menu on your compatible Roku player. The setting will NOT change when your Roku player reboots or when the software updates.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Advanced system settings\nSelect Advanced display settings\nSelect Auto-adjust display refresh rate and choose from the following\nEnabled \u2013 Your Roku player will automatically switch to the native format of the movie, video, or TV show when playback begins.\nNote:\nDue to video mode changes by your TV, the picture may flash to black when starting and stopping playback.

When enabled, titles on these channels will output at the same refresh rate.\nDisabled \u2013 Your Roku player will output ALL content at 60fps.\nWhy is video jerky when watching a movie or video?\n\nWhen auto-adjust display refresh rate is disabled, your Roku player outputs all content at 60fps. A movie filmed at 24fps, or a video shot at 25fps may exhibit subtle jerkiness due to the conversion to 60fps. To avoid this behavior, follow the steps listed above and enable auto-adjust display refresh rate. You may also need to adjust video settings on your TV. Consult the documentation included with your TV or contact the manufacturer directly.\n\nWhy do I see a black flash when starting a movie, video, or TV show?\n\nWhen auto-adjust display refresh rate is enabled, your Roku player switches to 24fps, 25fps, or 30fps during playback of most movies, videos or TV shows. Each time the display rate changes like this, your TV must change video modes which may cause a black flash. To avoid this behavior, follow the steps listed above and disable auto-adjust display refresh rate.\n\nLast updated on 3/11/2022, 2:41:39\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "556ec142-95ef-4de3-b978-7f054dfb61ce", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "03400c96e32cc36ddfb6e73b40399e835334a954702b23c7d8b9faece71e517a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3239}, "relationships": {"1": "6a27c778-d648-4c94-bc46-e85b8bb3f108"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5995518b-6afc-4f60-8348-2d7f9e91e149": {"__data__": {"text": "How to set up your Roku\u00ae HD\n\nRoku HD (model: 3932) supports video resolutions up to 1080p Full HD and ships with a Roku simple (IR) remote.

It is designed to be removable without leaving a sticky residue, and as a result, can only be used one time. Should you choose to attach your player to a flat surface, it is recommended you only use the included strip.

Should this happen, you may see an on-screen error message similar to the one below.\n\nOr in some cases, you may see an on-screen message similar to the following.\n\nIn the message, you will typically see one of the following error codes: 001, 002, 003, 004, or 005 and others.\n\nHow to get the software to update successfully\n\nIt is possible that the Roku service may be temporarily unresponsive. If an error code is encountered during an attempt to update the software, wait a few minutes and try again. If Roku is aware of an extended outage, an alert will be displayed near the top of the Roku support site. If you see an alert here, try again when the outage is over.\n\nIf there is no alert and you continue to see the error message after multiple attempts, the update failure is likely the result of a network connectivity issue. Try the steps below to help resolve the problem.\n\nDid you connect your Roku player or Roku TV to the correct network? Selecting the wrong wireless network name (also called SSID) will cause your wireless network connection to fail. If you are not sure that your Roku device is connected to the correct network, get help finding your wireless network name and password.\nCheck to see that your router* is working properly. Use your computer or a mobile device to connect to the router and access the internet (try launching a website like www.roku.com). If you are able to connect to the internet on other devices, go to the next step.\nDo you have a strong enough wireless signal? If your password is correct and other devices can access the router, but the software update continues to fail, the most likely problem is the strength of the wireless signal. The wireless signal gets weaker the farther your Roku player or Roku TV is from your router, and with more obstacles (like walls and cabinets) between your router and your Roku device. Review these tips to help improve your wireless signal.\nIf you see an error message that indicates your Roku wireless audio device is disconnected when the device it is paired with tries to update the software, check that your wireless audio device is plugged in and the status LED on the device is on. You may need to it closer to the device it is paired with if the problem continues.

It will take a few minutes before both devices have restarted.\n\n\nTo restart your Roku player or Roku TV, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it.

In some cases, you can simply unplug it and plug it back in, and in other cases it may require pressing a reset button on the device.\n\n\nIf you have previously connected to your router, the Roku device should automatically reconnect. If it is not reconnecting, or if you are setting up your Roku device for the first time, complete the network setup process.\nWi-Fi vs. Ethernet\n\nA Roku player or Roku TV has the ability to connect to your router via Wi-Fi\u00ae, or wireless. Some Roku devices also have an Ethernet port or support for a third-party Ethernet adapter, both of which allow you to use a cable to connect to your network.\n\nIf it is convenient to connect the cable from your router to your compatible Roku device, Ethernet will give you a faster and more reliable connection. Simply connect a standard Ethernet cable from an available port on your router to your compatible Roku device.\nWireless can also give you excellent results, provided you are located close enough to your router to receive a clear signal.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*A note on terminology:\n\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.\n\nLast updated on 11/17/2022, 7:15:08\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "e689efbc-95f0-4b95-82ff-aa0a3b572c55", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c3c2a81a5682eaae24e90f47d22eb2679353520f26a6271482669ac99538ca30", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3419, "end": 6293}, "relationships": {"1": "288e8051-a24c-41fb-a181-7717602a3073", "2": "646bb55a-3491-4784-9fd3-01151f624a27"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7889ba39-7738-4b63-bce2-42813628398b": {"__data__": {"text": "How to disable auto power savings on your Roku\u00ae streaming player\n\nSome Roku streaming players have an auto power savings feature that allows the player to automatically save power under certain conditions. This article describes auto power savings in more detail and outlines steps you can take if you want to disable the feature.\n\nHow does auto power savings work?\n\nWhen auto power savings is enabled and your compatible Roku player is idle for 20 minutes (meaning it is not streaming content or being controlled by a remote or mobile app), it automatically enters a low power mode and attempts to power off the TV it is connected to. While in the low power mode, your player will \"wake up\" when you do any one of the following:\n\nPower on your TV\nPress a button on your Roku remote\nControl your player with the free Roku mobile app for iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122\nShare content using AirPlay\u00ae\nCast from a mobile app like Netflix\u00ae or YouTube\u00ae\n\nAfter your player wakes up, your TV will turn on and a moment later the Roku home screen will appear.\n\nDoes my Roku player support auto power savings?\n\nTo view the model number, go to the home screen on your Roku player and select Settings > System > About.

If this does not help, try disabling auto power savings as described above.\n\nIf you find that your player is waking up but not when you press the Power button  on your Roku remote, you should make sure to set up your remote to control the power and volume on your TV.\n\nWhat else to try if you want to use auto power savings\n\nIf disabling auto power savings resolved your issue in the previous section, but you prefer to use the power-savings feature, there are a couple more things you can try.\n\nEnable 1-touch play on your player\n\nWhen enabled, a feature called 1-touch play tells your TV to automatically switch its active source/input to your Roku player when any button on your Roku remote is pressed. Open the Settings menu and enable 1-touch play using the steps below.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Control other devices\nCheck the box next to 1-touch play\nEnable CEC on your TV\n\nA feature known as HDMI-CEC (or just CEC) lets devices on the same HDMI connection send commands to each other, which is how your Roku player can turn on your TV or your TV can wake your Roku player. For this to function properly, it is important to check that your TV supports CEC and that the feature is enabled. It is not uncommon for CEC to be disabled by default.\n\nWhen looking for the setting on your TV, keep in mind that some manufacturers such as Hitachi and Vizio refer to CEC by its proper name, while others like LG, Panasonic, and Sony use brand-specific trade names. For help understanding the various trade names, review the detailed article outlining how several popular TV brands go about enabling CEC.\n\nLast updated on 7/1/2022, 8:52:59\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "7889ba39-7738-4b63-bce2-42813628398b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d6ad684ae828861598dad5868c980d26108ec3133a13150e769246ee57afcd90", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3769}, "relationships": {"1": "e1445924-9450-4304-a513-f4fb618d1295"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "726c52aa-5eee-4d9d-89a3-b78cfeaf5b51": {"__data__": {"text": "How to use Recovery Mode on your Roku TV\u2122\n\nIf you have tried a system restart, network reset, and factory reset but your Roku TV continues to be unresponsive, you can use Recovery Mode to try and restore normal operation.

Should this happen, your TV may get confused and switch to a different device when you try and control your Roku streaming player with your Roku remote.\n\nWhat is HDMI?\nHDMI, or High-Definition Multimedia Interface\u00ae, is the standard for connecting video and audio equipment. In addition to delivering both the audio and video signals, a single HDMI cable also allows devices to communicate via CEC.\t\nWhat is CEC?\n\nCEC, or Consumer Electronics Control, is a feature of the HDMI standard that allows your HDMI-connected devices to work better together. By exchanging information such as the current volume, which device is providing audio and video, and which remote-control buttons are pressed, devices can often be controlled over HDMI with a single remote control.\n\nCEC is known by several manufacturer-specific trade names; for example, Sony Bravia Sync, LG SimpLink, and Samsung Anynet+. Other manufacturers like Hitachi and Vizio use the standard term HDMI-CEC or CEC.\n\nSome Roku players support a CEC feature called 1-touch play that tells your TV to automatically switch its active source/input to your Roku player when any button on your Roku remote is pressed.\n\nNote: If your Roku remote has volume up and volume down buttons, pressing either button will not trigger 1-touch play.\nWhat to do if your TV is switching to a different source\n\nIf your TV is switching its active source/input to another device when you attempt to control your Roku player, try one or more of the following suggestions until a resolution is found.\n\nDisconnect and reconnect the HDMI cable. Unplug both ends of the HDMI cable that connects your Roku player and your TV. Wait several seconds and then firmly reattach both ends of the HDMI cable, making sure to use the same HDMI port on your TV.\n\nIf the behavior continues, move to the next suggestion.\n\nTry another HDMI input on your TV. Disconnect the HDMI cable from your TV and firmly connect it to another HDMI input and test. It is possible that the behavior is not present on all HDMI inputs.\n\nIf you continue to see another device when controlling your Roku player, move to the next suggestion.\n\nPower cycle your Roku player and your TV. Unplug the power cord from both your Roku player and your TV. After several moments, plug the cords back in and power on both devices. Test again.\n\nIf you continue to see the behavior, move to the next suggestion.\n\nConnect your Roku player directly to your TV if you are using an AVR. If your Roku player is connected to your TV through an HDMI input on your audio/video receiver (AVR), try removing your Roku player from the AVR and connect it directly to an available HDMI input on your TV.\n\nIf you continue to see the behavior, move to the next suggestion.\n\nUpdate the TV firmware. Make sure your TV is connected to the internet and update the firmware. If you need help, contact the manufacturer of your TV.\n\nFinally, if the behavior is still happening, try the last suggestion.\n\nDisable 1-touch play. On your Roku player, open the settings and disable 1-touch play using the steps below.\nSelect Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Control other devices\nUncheck 1-touch play if the box is checked\nNote: If 1-touch play is not enabled, disable CEC on your TV instead. Contact the manufacturer if you are unable to locate the CEC settings on your TV.\nPower cycle your Roku player\nLast updated on 3/9/2022, 4:31:39\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "8477f816-7f51-4656-b02b-5932b8515d6e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "26a7fd648e1eb739e6cb0351dbb48f69fa91be71fa2cf28f69a839066d34abb9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3758}, "relationships": {"1": "fa0f7bbb-e9f1-4e3c-af06-6c9af2819603"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dc7c801-0740-4d00-9e90-d5c35fe44a44": {"__data__": {"text": "How to manage channels using the Roku\u00ae mobile app\n\nThe Roku\u00ae mobile app is a free application for iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122 devices that turns your mobile device into a control center for your Roku streaming device.

However, you may not be able to view Dolby Vision content at 4K resolution if your Dolby Vision-capable TV was manufactured prior to 2018. These models, and a few manufactured in later years, only support 4K Dolby Vision at lower frame rates like 30 frames per second (fps). Unfortunately, some streaming channels, such as Netflix, will not play 4K Dolby Vision when the TV does not support higher frame rates like 60fps.\n\nThis article helps you determine why 4K Dolby Vision may not play on your TV and offers options to resolve the issue or choose an alternate configuration. Visit the Roku product comparison chart to determine if your player supports Dolby Vision.\n\nHow to know if your TV supports Dolby Vision\n\nDolby Vision is an advanced form of HDR (High Dynamic Range) available on high-end TV models that improves image quality with more accurate color and contrast details on a scene-by-scene basis.\n\nTo determine if your TV supports Dolby Vision, your Roku streaming player automatically checks the capabilities of the HDMI connection whenever connected. To see the automatic settings, go to Settings > Display type > Automatic.\n\nWhat to do if the HDMI connection does not support 4K Dolby Vision\n\nIf your TV supports Dolby Vision and you see the message below, you may need to adjust a setting on your TV called FreeSync.\n\nFreeSync is designed to enhance your experience with a connected game console (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation), but with some TV models, FreeSync may disable Dolby Vision. To correct this behavior, you need to adjust the settings on your TV to disable FreeSync on the HDMI port where your Roku player is connected.\n\nYou can refer to the sample instructions below if you have an LG TV, but the steps may vary from model to model, and may change when TV software is updated. When in doubt, refer to the user manual or online documentation for your specific make and model.\n\nLG: Go to Home > HDMI > Settings > Advanced > Picture > Additional Settings > FreeSync > Off > Restart\n\nA note on HDMI cables\n\nRoku players that support HDR ship with an HDMI 2.0 compatible cable. If you cannot use the included cable, be sure to purchase a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable. The typically more expensive Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is a good choice for reducing potential Wi-Fi\u00ae and Bluetooth\u00ae interference, or for future-proofing an installation where the cable location is in an otherwise inaccessible area. Cables that are not labeled or may be labeled \"high speed\" or \"standard speed\" may not be adequate for 4K HDR10, HDR10+, or Dolby Vision content at 60fps.\n\nIf your Roku player is connected to an AVR or soundbar, make sure all cables are HDMI 2.0 compatible. If you see a black screen or poor performance and video degradation with a 4K HDR signal, replace any older cables with a Premium High Speed HDMI Cable or Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable.\n\nLast updated on 12/1/2022, 9:12:58\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "51d2a7f0-ec4e-4efc-84c4-610a43448d7f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eef004728d74420d2807ae2b9ad1d7dc5c19739b1b42515bacdc66bd641bfc49", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3137}, "relationships": {"1": "4d75ead6-d356-4d57-80d3-301a47dbfb07"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "598f7be1-8bd3-4b72-947c-d07e5c53fcaf": {"__data__": {"text": "Why does the picture from my cable or satellite box look bad on my Roku TV\u2122?\n\nIf your Roku TV supports 8K Ultra HD, it has two different types of HDMI\u00ae inputs. When a device that outputs an interlaced video signal is connected to the wrong type of input, you may see the following on-screen message.\n\nThis article provides more details about interlaced video and your 8K Roku TV and explains what to do to get the best picture from your cable or satellite set-top box.\n\nWhat is interlaced video?\n\nBefore the days of 4K and 8K Ultra High Definition, video resolutions were expressed as the vertical number of pixels on your TV screen. Traditionally, this numerical value was accompanied by an 'i' to indicate the video signal was interlaced (e.g., 480i, 576i, or 1080i), or a 'p' to indicate it was progressive (e.g., 480p, 576p, 720p, 1080p).\n\nInterlaced - An interlaced signal sends only half of the information captured in each video frame at a time, delivering the odd pixel lines first (1, 3, 5...) followed by the even pixel lines (2, 4, 6...). This uses less bandwidth but requires your TV to combine these \"fields\" using a process called de-interlacing to draw the complete frame. This happens fast enough that your eyes see the entire frame, but you may notice flickering or motion artifacts such as jagged edges, especially in fast-moving scenes.\n\nProgressive - A progressive signal sends the full video frame at one time delivering all the pixel lines to fill the screen. This requires more bandwidth but appears smoother and more realistic and reduces flicker and artifacts.\n\nDevices using the latest technologies use a progressive signal, but many older devices like cable and satellite boxes may still use an interlaced signal.\n\nWhich HDMI input should I use for an interlaced signal?\n\nYour 8K Roku TV has two specialized HDMI inputs designed for optimal playback of 8K content and the low-latency processing required for high-end game consoles. It also has two standard HDMI inputs that can do proper de-interlacing. To get the best picture form any device that uses an interlaced signal, use HDMI 3 or HDMI 4.\n\nInputs optimized for 8K playback and low-latency gaming devices:\n\nHDMI 1\nHDMI 2\n\nInputs with de-interlacing to properly process interlaced signals:\n\nHDMI 3\nHDMI 4\nLast updated on 1/3/2022, 2:16:32\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "598f7be1-8bd3-4b72-947c-d07e5c53fcaf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8dc6a1e30ecde719628267bd4cb8b54025ed50aee3af79050ab8f8fd78580ee2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2351}, "relationships": {"1": "b0e14901-a54c-4ef8-9aaf-535d8a6c4d51"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2b481d0-461d-4599-8c5d-5b950b8807a8": {"__data__": {"text": "What to do if you see \"Can't run channel\" on your Roku\u00ae streaming device\nWhy do I see an error message?\n\nYou will see the \"Can't run channel\" or \"Insufficient memory\" error message when your Roku\u00ae streaming device is unable to download and install a channel.\n\nHow to fix the issue\n\nFree up available memory by removing one or more infrequently used channels.\n\nRemoving channels from within your channel lineup\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nMove to the right and highlight the channel you wish to remove\nPress Star  on your remote to open the Options menu\nSelect Remove channel and confirm when prompted\nNote: If deleting channels does not free up memory on your Roku streaming device, please contact Roku support for help.\nLast updated on 7/11/2022, 10:52:46\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "f2b481d0-461d-4599-8c5d-5b950b8807a8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8a011131a03eb49faed3e27d0b8c17cd305592f7a373c332ea246ed8841e4c2f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 790}, "relationships": {"1": "5b429e36-7736-4880-b182-0ccb6f569a96"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "221e98ff-a49b-4e44-b10c-c02d91439caf": {"__data__": {"text": "Why can I not find Spotify in the Roku Channel Store?\n\nOn a supported Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TV\u2122, Spotify lets you discover, manage and share over 35 million songs for free, or upgrade to Spotify Premium to access exclusive features including improved sound quality and ad-free listening.

You can sometimes improve signal strength by adjusting the location or position of the HDTV antenna.\nTry a different USB drive - The USB drive may have bad blocks or might be too slow for live video recording.

If you purchase an annual subscription on January 1 and cancel it on January 31, you'll still have access to your subscription until December 31.\n\nWithout a subscription, the home monitoring system can be used to self-monitor your home.

If your remote has a voice button (as seen below), you have a Roku voice remote. If it does not, you have a Roku simple remote.\n\nWhat is a Roku simple remote?\n\nA Roku simple remote uses invisible infrared (IR) light to transmit button presses a short distance. For a simple remote to operate reliably, it must be pointed directly at the Roku streaming device (it is controlling) and there must be nothing that could block the signal from travelling to the front of that device (where the IR receiver is located).\n\nRoku simple remotes include the buttons seen in the example below including channel shortcut buttons that let you launch popular streaming channels with a single press.\n\nA simple remote is included with many Roku TV models and some streaming players such as the current generation Roku Express and Roku Premiere. The simple remote included with a Roku TV has all the buttons seen on a player remote (like the example above), along with buttons to control power and volume on the TV.\n\nTo set up a simple remote, you only need to insert new matching batteries and point the remote at the front of your Roku device. For more help, learn how to resolve issues with your simple remote.\n\nWhat is a Roku voice remote?\n\nA Roku voice remote connects over a wireless network and does not need to be pointed directly at your Roku streaming player or Roku TV when pressing buttons. This allows you to install your Roku streaming player behind a wall-mounted TV or another nearby, out-of-sight location. Voice remotes will either have a pairing button or a button combination to initiate the pairing process and establish the dedicated wireless connection with your Roku streaming device. You can learn more about how to set up or pair your Roku voice remote.\u00a0\n\nVoice remotes have the same buttons you find on a simple remote, along with the voice button mentioned above that allows you to use push-to-talk voice to search and control your Roku device. Simply press and hold the button and say a command like \"search for comedies\" or \"launch The Roku Channel\" in a conversational tone at normal volume. After you release the button, your streaming\u00a0 device will carry out your request, delivering you to the Roku Search screen or elsewhere within the Roku interface.\n\nWhat other features are available on Roku voice remotes?\n\nIn addition to push-to-talk voice, different Roku voice remote models offer the following features which may or may not be included on your remote:\n\nTV controls: Use dedicated buttons to control power and volume on your TV with a single remote. Some voice remotes also have a dedicated mute button.\nPrivate listening: When you do not want to disturb others nearby, plug your headphones into the audio jack on the side of your voice remote and listen to your favorite entertainment while the speakers in the TV mute automatically. Use the buttons on the side of your remote to adjust volume and unplug your headphones when you want to turn off the feature.\nPersonal shortcuts: Create a personal shortcut and with the press of a single button, you can launch a popular streaming channel, open the Live TV guide, issue an often-used voice command, and more.

It cannot directly control other devices connected to your TV, such as an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar.\n\nHowever, your TV may be able to issue volume commands to your AVR or soundbar using a technology called HDMI-CEC. In these cases, your Roku voice remote can indirectly control volume for your AVR or soundbar. For this to work, all your devices must be connected via HDMI\u00ae, and all devices must support HDMI-CEC and have this feature enabled. To learn if your TV, AVR or soundbar supports this technology refer to the documentation for each device. Be aware that manufacturers may refer to HDMI-CEC by a different name.\n\nWhat to know before setting up your voice remote\nDuring initial setup and activation, you will be able to set up your voice remote to control power and volume for your TV. You can also set it up later by visiting Settings > Remotes & Devices > Remotes > [select your remote] > Set up remote for TV control.\nDuring the remote setup, your Roku device will attempt to automatically detect the brand of your TV (over the HDMI connection) and program your Roku voice remote. In cases where the brand cannot be detected automatically, you will be taken through a series of steps to manually enter the brand and help program your remote (see setup section below).\nWhen information is gathered via HDMI, often only the brand of the device connected directly to your Roku device can be detected. For this reason, we recommend you always connect your Roku device directly to your TV during setup. If you plan to set up your Roku device for surround sound, temporarily connect your Roku device directly to your TV and complete setup before making any connections to the AVR or soundbar.\nHow to set up your voice remote DURING initial setup and activation\n\nWhen you set up your Roku device for the first time, you will need to connect it to the internet and set the display type before you are presented with the screen to Check remote settings. This is the first step to setting up your remote to control power and volume for your TV.\n\nBefore you begin, adjust volume on your TV to an audible level. As you make selections, keep your Roku voice remote pointed directly at your TV.\n\nSelect Check remote settings to begin\nWhen you hear music playing, select Yes to confirm. If you do not hear music playing, try increasing volume using your TV remote.\n\n\n\n\nNext, your Roku device attempts to mute volume using remote codes for the detected TV brand. If the music stops, select Yes.\n\n\n\nIf the music continues to play, select No. Your Roku device was unable to detect the correct information about your TV, however, you can manually enter the brand by selecting Enter TV brand.\n\n\n\nAs you enter the brand using the on-screen keyboard, a list to the right populates. After you select the brand, music begins playing again. Select Yes when you hear it. As before, your Roku device again attempts to mute volume, this time using the first of multiple remote codes for the TV brand you entered.

To use hands-free TV controls with your Roku Voice Remote Pro, you need to first make sure CEC is enabled on your TV to allow for this communication. Voice commands cannot be sent using IR technology.\n\nAfter you confirm CEC is enabled, begin using hands-free voice commands with a simple request such as \"Hey Roku, what time is it?\" and confirm you hear an expected response. Once you know hands-free voice is working, you can use commands like the examples below to control your TV.\n\n\"Hey Roku, turn on the TV\"\n\"Hey Roku, turn up the volume\"\n\"Hey Roku, set the volume to 11\"\n\"Hey Roku, turn off the TV\"\n\nRemember not to speak any slower or louder than you do in a normal conversation and do not overpronounce syllables or words. Speak naturally with a clear and direct \"Hey Roku...\".\n\nNote: Not all TV models support CEC, and some may offer limited support. You may find some commands work but not others. Consult your TV manual to understand how CEC works on your TV.\nTroubleshooting\n\nAs described above, your Roku device plays music to help during the setup process. If you do not hear the music or it does not mute correctly, review the troubleshooting steps for setting up your Roku voice remote to control power and volume on your TV.\n\nLast updated on 10/17/2022, 11:27:16\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "0280a62b-4e92-413f-a3bd-dc59df6c271b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cc31d6b5ad630a62b7a52b452f6db0139fa7303f4d5dfbe542e1ee1bcd516430", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3457, "end": 6609}, "relationships": {"1": "346af090-b824-4dfb-858d-a01f18260e4c", "2": "2646f93a-6c4f-418c-93cb-aa0cc2ed301b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfe915cd-d06f-4653-9a34-1d93520aad4f": {"__data__": {"text": "Why is my Roku\u00ae voice remote not controlling power and volume on my TV?\n\nSome Roku voice remotes incorporate both wireless and infrared (IR) technologies letting you seamlessly control your Roku streaming device along with aspects of your TV.

For help starting that process, visit the detailed article about setting up your voice remote to control your TV. If you encounter any issues during setup, there are a number of suggestions for you to try below.\n\nIf you are not sure that your voice remote has TV controls, read more about the different types of Roku remotes.\n\nWhy do I not hear music during setup?\n\nIf during the setup process you cannot hear the music playing after increasing volume using the TV remote (with fresh batteries), check the following:\n\nMake sure all devices connected to your Roku device support audio over HDMI. For example, many overhead projectors do not have speakers.\nWhy am I unable to mute the music with my Roku voice remote?\n\nWhen the music cannot be muted during setup, the on-screen menu prompts you to enter the brand of your TV and try setup again. If you still are unable to get your Roku voice remote programmed with this method, take note of the following:\n\nCheck for any obstructions between your remote and the IR receiver on front of your TV (commonly located along the bottom edge of the bezel). To mute the music, your remote needs direct line of sight to this sensor. If you cannot locate the IR receiver on your TV, refer to the manufacturer's online documentation or contact them directly.\nLimit the number of devices connected between your Roku device and the TV. Removing a device, even if done temporarily, may confirm that the device is causing the behavior.

During the remote setup, your Roku device will attempt to narrow this list of possible codes on your specific TV brand and program your voice remote to the correct code. It is possible that the code programmed into your voice remote when you heard the music stop only contains commands to control either power or volume, but not both. Using a different code for the TV brand may work to control both power and volume.\n\nTo have your Roku device try additional remote codes, restart the TV controls setup process for your voice remote and alter the steps as follows:\n\nWhen you first hear the music stop and are asked \u201cDid the music stop playing?\u201d, do not answer the question. Instead, turn volume back up with your TV remote until the music is audible again.\nNow, answer the question with No and your Roku device will move on to try the next remote code.\nThe next time you hear the music stop, answer the question with Yes and your voice remote will be programmed with the new code.\nIn rare cases, you may need to repeat this process, answering No to multiple codes before you find a code that controls both power and volume.\nWhy do the power and volume buttons only work sometimes?\n\nThere are two ways your Roku voice remote can send commands to your TV.\n\nInfrared (or IR): As mentioned earlier, IR technology requires you point your remote directly at your TV for each button press.

If CEC is not enabled or your TV does not support it, the voice command will not work even if pressing the power and volume buttons on your remote does work (this is because your remote can also use IR to send these commands as described in the previous section).\n\nTo fix the issue, go to the settings on your TV and make sure CEC is enabled.\n\nNote: Not all TV models support CEC, and some may only support power and not volume. Consult your TV manual for more information.\n\nFor more help using push-to-talk or hands-free voice commands, check out the detailed article about using your voice to search and control your Roku device.\n\nWarm or hot to touch\n\nIf the back of your Roku remote gets warm or hot during normal use, the rechargeable battery may be damaged or the alkaline batteries may be corroded.\n\nDiscontinue use of your remote.\nDisconnect your rechargeable remote from the charging cable.\nPlace remote on a hard non-flammable surface (like tile) and let it cool.

With no wires, the battery powered remote can be placed anywhere you can hear your Roku device. This article describes the product in more detail and outlines the setup steps.\n\nWhere to use your tabletop remote\n\nRoku Touch is a simple remote designed to help you quickly control your Roku device when you are somewhere nearby, but not specifically sitting in your primary viewing location. Without all the same buttons you find on your handheld Roku remote, it is not intended to replace that remote, but instead work with it to improve your overall streaming experience.\n\nWhere you decide to use your Roku Touch will depend on the layout of your home and the room where the Roku device you plan to control is located. If you have an open floor plan, you may want to rest your Roku Touch on an entryway table so you can start playback of some relaxing music after a long day at the office. You may decide to set it on a desk and launch popular podcasts from afar when you are paying the monthly bills. If your kitchen is nearby, rest your Roku Touch on the counter for those times you need to pause the kids' show or turn down the volume when it is time for dinner. Or, set it next to the coffee maker and start listening to a radio news program while brewing a fresh pot each morning.\n\nNote: Your Roku Touch tabletop remote must be used within listening distance of your Roku device. The usable distance can be degraded by some building materials and the stability of your wireless network.\nPair your Roku Touch\n\nTo pair your Roku Touch, you must put it in pairing mode along with your Roku device. To begin, use the following steps to put your Roku player or Roku TV in pairing mode.\n\nPress Home  on your handheld Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect Remotes & devices\nSelect Pair new device\nSelect Remote\n\nWhen your Roku device is in pairing mode, an on-screen progress indicator tells you when it is searching for, and pairing with the remote. Use the steps below to put your Roku Touch into pairing mode and complete the pairing process.\n\nRemove the battery cover from the bottom of your tabletop remote and insert two new AAA batteries\nPress and hold the pairing button located in the battery compartment for 5 seconds, or until you see the light inside the compartment begin to flash. This pairing indicator will be accompanied by your tabletop remote telling you it is \"searching for devices\".\nAfter the remote pairs automatically, your Roku device will return to the Remotes & devices menu.\n\nNow that your Roku Touch is paired with your Roku device, you should learn about the buttons that let you search and control your Roku device.\n\nNote: The diamond button  on Roku Touch is reserved for future use.\nUse voice commands\n\nUsing voice commands with your Roku Touch gives you quick access to your favorite music, live radio stations, popular podcasts, and more from Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn. If you have a Roku TV, you can even use voice commands to search and control your music when the TV screen is off.\n\nFor the best experience, Pandora and TuneIn require you create an account and log in to start listening to free or premium content. If you want to begin listening right away, iHeartRadio gives you access to free content without an account, but you will need to create one if you plan to subscribe to their premium services.\n\nWhen you are ready, you can press and hold the Voice button  and speak naturally saying a command like, \"listen to classical music on Pandora\", \"play Stuff You Should Know on iHeartRadio\", or \"play Today's Hits on TuneIn\". Your Roku device will launch the specified channel and begin playing the music, radio station, or podcast audio.

To begin, press and hold the Voice button  and say a voice command like \"play classic rock\". Next, wait for the command to be executed, and then press and hold the personal shortcut button until you hear the success tone come from your Roku Touch.\n\nThe personal shortcut button is now programmed to the last voice command you issued. Any time you press it, that voice command will be issued with a single touch.\n\nNote: You can reassign personal shortcut buttons as often as you like.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, read about how you can program a personal shortcut button\u00a0on your Roku Touch tabletop remote.\n\nWhy are the volume buttons not working?\n\nThe volume buttons on your Roku Touch tabletop remote will control the volume on all Roku TV models, but when paired with a Roku player, the volume buttons may not work. This is because your Roku Touch cannot directly control devices that are connected to your Roku player, such as your TV (and its built-in speakers), an audio/video receiver (AVR), or soundbar.\n\nHowever, your Roku player may be able to send volume commands to your TV, AVR, or soundbar using a technology called HDMI-CEC. In these cases, your Roku Touch remote can indirectly control volume for your TV, AVR, or soundbar. For this to work, all your devices must be connected via HDMI, and all devices must support HDMI-CEC and have this feature enabled. To learn if your TV, AVR or soundbar supports this technology, refer to the device's documentation.\n\nNote: Manufacturers may refer to HDMI-CEC by a different name, such as Sony BRAVIA Sync, LG SimpLink, and Samsung Anynet+. Other manufacturers like Hitachi and Vizio use the standard term HDMI-CEC or CEC.\nLast updated on 12/10/2021, 10:59:07\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "95f6c435-a888-426c-8274-b4f8f0614aef", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "31c80f2c7bf074bcdcb5dbbd5a3cfe876b3e518412b6e975ffa8598ab73b02ca", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3386, "end": 6111}, "relationships": {"1": "65c59bed-990f-4c51-8338-f4a9c2246ff2", "2": "1fe8ef59-b2f5-4c6f-adec-9363c90728ab"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "879d0458-7927-4778-8cae-5b1fce88bbed": {"__data__": {"text": "How to resolve an issue with your Roku Touch\u2122 tabletop remote\n\nRemote issues differ based on the type of Roku\u00ae remote.

This allows you to start music playback or control your Roku device from a nearby location that may not be in direct line of sight, such as an entryway table or kitchen counter.\n\nDuring setup, your Roku Touch attempts to establish a connection with your Roku device through a process called \u201cpairing\u201d. When you select Settings > Remotes & devices > Set up a new device > Remote, your Roku device begins searching for a remote to pair. When it finds your Roku Touch, you will see a message like the one below when pairing.\n\nAlternatively, if you restart your Roku device, it will enter pairing mode for a few moments looking for a remote to pair. If you press the pairing button located in the battery compartment of your Roku Touch during this time, you will see a message similar to the one below.\n\nIn either case, when the pairing process completes, your Roku Touch is ready to use.\n\nWhy is my Roku Touch not working?\n\nIf your Roku Touch tabletop remote is not working as expected (e.g., you are unable to control your Roku device, your remote is not pairing, pressing buttons does nothing), use the troubleshooting steps below to help resolve the issue.\n\nRestart your Roku device and remote\nOpen the battery compartment and remove the batteries from your remote.\nRemove the power cable from your Roku device, wait 5 seconds and then re-connect the power cable.\nTip: Roku TV\u2122 models and Roku players (with the exception of a Roku Streaming Stick\u00ae) can be controlled with a Roku simple (IR) remote.

Make sure your Roku device is listed as a compatible device before making a purchase.\nPro tips\n\nIf you are comfortable working with your networking equipment, you can make adjustments to your wireless router which may help your Roku device and remote perform better. You will likely need to use your computer or mobile device to sign into an admin tool on your router. If you cannot locate the username and password and believe they have not been changed (remember that passwords are typically case-sensitive), the default values may be listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website or user manual, or possibly on the bottom of the router. If you need help configuring your router or other network equipment, refer to the user manual or contact the manufacturer.\n\nConnect to the 5GHz wireless network: If your router and Roku device both support 5GHz, make sure it is enabled in the router settings and try connecting to the 5GHz wireless network (e.g., MyNetwork_5GHz). Changing the wireless channel on the router is not necessary when connecting to a 5GHz network.\n\nNote: Not all Roku devices support 5GHz networks. To see if your device supports 5GHz, consult the product comparison chart and check the Specifications section. If dual-band is listed, your device is compatible with 5GHz networks.\nChange the wireless channel: When your router automatically selects a wireless channel, it can lead to intermittent or slow connectivity due to undetected interference from other wireless devices. Try disabling this automatic setting on your router and choose a wireless channel manually.\n\nTip: To help you find uncongested wireless channels in your home, you can download a wireless analyzer app on your mobile device. Visit the app store for your mobile device to find a wireless network analyzer.\n\nIf your Roku device is already connected to the 5GHz wireless network and you still encounter an issue, try configuring your router to use a different 5GHz channel. If your router only supports 2.4GHz, try using wireless channels 1, 6, or 11 which are the preferred channels in North America. Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network: Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your Roku device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common.

In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet.

Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data over short distances (typically less than 30 feet). When Bluetooth headphones are connected, you can listen to any content streaming on your Roku device. If you have a Roku Streambar\u00ae or Streambar Pro you can also listen to audio from your TV, if connected via an HDMI ARC or optical connection. If your streaming device does not support Bluetooth private listening, you may be able to use wired headphones with a Roku voice remote for private listening instead.\n\nThis article provides instructions for pairing and connecting your Bluetooth earbuds or headphones to your compatible Roku streaming device.\n\nWhich devices are compatible with Bluetooth private listening?\n\nBluetooth private listening is only available on Roku streaming devices with Bluetooth capability. Any Bluetooth headphones that support Bluetooth version 4.2 or greater can connect to a compatible Roku streaming device. Visit the Roku product comparison chart to see which current Roku streaming devices have Bluetooth.\n\nCompatible Roku streaming devices\n\nThe following Roku streaming devices have Bluetooth capability:\n\nRoku Streambar\u00ae\nRoku Streambar Pro\nRoku Smart Soundbar\nRoku Ultra (models 4800 and 4802)\nRoku Ultra LT (model 4801)\nRoku Plus Series TV\n\nTo find the model of your Roku streaming device, you can go to the Home screen and select Settings > System > About.\n\nNote: The only TV that Bluetooth headphones can pair with for private listening is a Roku Plus Series TV. If a Roku Streambar, Roku Streambar Pro, or Roku Smart Soundbar is connected to your TV, you can still pair your headphones with the streambar or soundbar directly.\nHow to pair Bluetooth headphones\n\nBefore you can begin streaming Bluetooth audio, you need to pair your headphones to your compatible Roku streaming device. This is done through a discovery process which allows Bluetooth devices to register information about each other and then make a secure wireless connection. Because this pairing information is retained even when Bluetooth devices are powered off, it is typically only necessary to pair your Bluetooth device one time. After you complete the pairing process, your headphones will appear in the list of paired devices and a headphone icon  will appear on the television screen when adjusting volume.\n\nUse the steps below to pair your headphones:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect Remotes & devices\nSelect Wireless headphones\nSelect Add new wireless headphones\nTurn on your Bluetooth headphones and put them in pairing mode\nWait while your Roku device scans for Bluetooth headphones.

Each time you change the wireless channel, you will likely need to apply/save changes before you are prompted to restart the router.\n\nExclude DFS channels from your 5GHz wireless network: Roku streaming devices support 5GHz radio bands U-NII-1 (non-DFS channels 36 to 48) and U-NII-3 (non-DFS channels 149-165), but do not support bands U-NII-2A (DFS channels 50-64) and U-NII-2C (DFS channels 100-144). If your router is configured to use band U-NII-2A or UNII-2C, your Roku device will likely not connect to your 5GHz wireless network. Instead, it will connect to your 2.4GHz wireless network where congestion that leads to potential performance issues is more common. Additionally, if your 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless networks have different network names, your Roku device will only be able to connect to the 2.4GHz wireless network.\n\nTo optimize performance, visit the settings for your router and configure your 5GHz network to exclude DFS channels (U-NII-2A and U-NII-2C). After this change is made (and your router restarts), your Roku device should be able to connect to your 5GHz network.\n\n\nMove the router farther away: If your router is close to your Roku device, try moving it a little farther away. This may seem counter-intuitive but having the router too close to your Roku device may actually cause the wireless signal to degrade.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n*A note on terminology:\n\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem. In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLast updated on 3/9/2023, 6:00:04\u202fAM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "af8471e9-60f6-416a-8b29-79a879f3269d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a0c70262d820978cfd86104a8b373844fc46b19881de6816b2a90e19aa22d613", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 12261, "end": 15702}, "relationships": {"1": "0eef4dc6-0d66-4a1a-bdbd-13c135139ef7", "2": "dd5f9104-7a19-4cae-af26-6f80ddfeb40d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "43ffa111-8213-48d2-bc38-ceb0cdf8bfc3": {"__data__": {"text": "How to resolve issues connecting a Bluetooth device to your Roku device\n\nWith your compatible Roku\u00ae device, you can connect a smartphone, tablet, or computer via Bluetooth\u00ae, a wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data over short distances (typically less than 30 feet).

Check with your channel providers for details (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Disney+).\nWhat to do if the connection check shows a red \u2018x\u2019\nIf a red \u2018x\u2019 appears for Wireless connection (or Wired connection if your compatible Roku device is connected to a wired network), your Roku device cannot make a connection to your router.\n\n\n\nReturn to the Network menu, select Set up connection, and try again to connect your Roku device to your network.\n\nIf you are uncertain that you are selecting the correct network, get help finding the wireless network name and password.\n\nIf you continue to have problems, learn what to do if your Roku device cannot access your home network.\nIf a red \u2018x\u2019 appears for Internet connection, your Roku device is able to connect to your wireless network, but it is unable to make a connection to the internet.\n\n\n\nTo test the internet connection at your home, use your computer or a mobile device that is connected to your home network and try accessing a public website such as www.roku.com. If you cannot access the internet this way, contact your ISP and inquire about an outage in your area.\n\nIf you can access the internet from your computer or mobile device, double-check that you are connecting your Roku device to the correct wireless network. If the problem continues, restart your Roku device and the router.\nRestarting your Roku device and the router\n\nIf you continue seeing a red \u2018x\u2019 after trying the suggestions above, try restarting your router and Roku device using the instructions below.\n\nRestart your router\n\nTo restart your router properly, you may need to review instructions from your internet service provider (ISP) or router manufacturer. In some cases, you can simply unplug your router and plug it back in, and in other cases it may require pressing a reset button on the device. For help, visit the website for your ISP or router manufacturer, or contact them directly.\n\nRestart your Roku device\n\nTo restart your Roku device, you can either unplug the power cable, wait a moment, and then reconnect it. Or you can use the following steps to restart it from the Settings menu.\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect System\nSelect Power. If you do not see a Power submenu, skip to the next step.\nSelect System restart\n\n\u00a0\n\n*A note on terminology:\n\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem.

When such a limit is exceeded, penalties can include additional fees, slowed download speeds, and even blocked service. If your ISP has a bandwidth cap, you can use a feature called Bandwidth Saver to help avoid going over your monthly data limit by automatically halting streaming after four hours of inactivity on your Roku\u00ae streaming player or Roku TV\u2122.\n\nThis article provides more information on Bandwidth Saver, and helps you disable the feature if you do not wish to use it.\n\nHow does Bandwidth Saver work?\n\nWhen you interact with playback using your Roku remote or the free Roku mobile app, the Roku platform interprets the action as activity on your Roku device. If your device is streaming for four hours where no commands are received from your Roku remote or the mobile app, the Roku platform interprets this as inactivity on your Roku device. After those four hours, your Roku device will display a prompt asking you to confirm that you are still watching.\n\nIf you select Keep streaming, playback will continue uninterrupted. If you do nothing, playback will stop after a moment, your Roku device will exit the channel back to your Home screen, and data will no longer be downloaded over your internet connection.\n\nIf you see the message on a channel you frequently use for more than four hours without using your Roku remote or the mobile app, you can select Don't ask again for this channel and the prompt will never again appear for that channel.\n\nWhy does the prompt appear after 4 hours?\n\nResearch shows that four hours without remote activity is a good indicator that no one is watching the content being streamed since most movie and TV shows are less than 4 hours, including sports-related content.\n\nHow to disable Bandwidth Saver\n\nAs described in the previous section, you can select Don't ask again for this channel to disable the prompt for the particular channel you are watching when the message appears. Alternatively, you can disable the prompt for all streaming channels using the instructions below:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings\nSelect Network\nSelect Bandwidth saver\nChoose Off\nNote: Some streaming channels employ their own mechanism to cease data usage after a specific period of inactivity. These features will not be affected when you disable Bandwidth Saver.\nLast updated on 4/10/2023, 1:46:01\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "974265ca-196c-4dee-9f7c-9b9bcd856303", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c4998274c1103404eb17c05b64efebac8b360eb3881a4499b0e77113266e22ad", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2654}, "relationships": {"1": "92a2ab10-5573-4ca6-9824-bf2d46f9c25a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "07b5a2d1-d93e-4474-b020-1e309528abf4": {"__data__": {"text": "How to use USB to connect your Roku streaming device to a wired network\n\nTo stream your favorite content from the internet, your Roku\u00ae device must maintain a good connection to your network and the internet.

Look for an adapter that only supports 10/100 Mbps speeds. Adapters that also support 1000 Mbps will not work.\nChipset: Find an adapter that has an AX8877X or SMSC95XX chipset. This information is typically available with the manufacturer specifications.\nInterface: An adapter with a standard USB connector is needed for your Roku Streambar or soundbar.

In some cases, your internet service provider (ISP) may have provided you with a single integrated device that includes a cable modem and a router, or you may have purchased a stand-alone router from a company such as Linksys, NETGEAR, ASUS, Belkin or D-Link. In this article, the term router is used as a generic term to refer to the network device that your Roku device must connect to access the internet. For more information refer to the documentation provided by your ISP or router manufacturer.\n\nLast updated on 11/11/2022, 1:37:44\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "997f811c-cd86-4bb8-8677-dd0c9177507c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dcc2a1029236914a0249f80214816845b5d5107143726e8c31db2728841882ff", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7519, "end": 10000}, "relationships": {"1": "9e637df7-6664-4142-b1b4-ed03a402597f", "2": "1a3ac7fb-c0b5-494c-ae4e-91c584919ab6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "de88bdf4-80b7-46a7-a440-fe5bc657fdc3": {"__data__": {"text": "How to use Amazon Alexa to control your Roku Smart Home devices\n\nAlexa is the voice service from Amazon and is connected to the Alexa app, as well as other voice-activated devices like your Amazon Echo Spot, Amazon Echo Show, Amazon Fire TV, or Amazon Fire Tablet.

All smart home devices support a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi\u00ae connection and some devices, such as the Roku Home Monitoring System SE, also support a wired Ethernet connection. The Roku Smart Home mobile app shares settings from your phone or tablet over a secure wireless connection. To help make the initial connection, some Roku Smart Home devices need to scan a QR code generated by the mobile app while others use Bluetooth\u00ae.\n\nYou may see an error like \"Connection failed\", \"Hub not found\", \"No lights found\", or \"No plugs found\" in the mobile app.\n\nThis article describes provides instructions for fixing connection issues.\n\nHow to fix the connection\n\nBefore you look at the suggestions below, check that your smart home camera, home monitoring hub, doorbell, bulb, plug, or light strip is powered on and if the device has a status light, check that it is working as described in the smart home app. If the status light does not match the description in the app, the smart home device cannot be connected.\n\nEnable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: Open the settings menu on your phone or tablet and depending on which type of smart home device your trying to connect, check that Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is enabled. For help, refer to the manufacturer's website or contact them directly.\nTest Wi-Fi: Open a web browser and try visiting a public website such as www.roku.com. If this is unsuccessful, your Wi-Fi network is down and you should first inquire about an outage with your internet service provider (ISP). If they are not aware of an issue, try restarting your router*. To restart your router properly, you may need to review instructions from your ISP or router manufacturer. In some cases, you can simply unplug your router and plug it back in, and in other cases it may require pressing a reset button on the device. For help, visit the website for your ISP or router manufacturer, or contact them directly.\nDouble check the network name: Many Wi-Fi routers today use two signals to provide better speed and coverage. These devices are generally referred to as dual-band routers because they transmit data at the lower 2.4GHz band and the higher 5GHz band. When connecting devices to your wireless network, choices may include more than one network with a similar name. For example, you may see something like MyNetwork_2.4GHz and MyNetwork_5GHz. Make sure you are selecting the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network.\nCheck the Ethernet cable: If using a wired internet connection, use the included Ethernet cable and make sure the cable is firmly connected to your smart home device and router.\nIs your Apple device permitted to access other devices over Wi-Fi? If you have an iPhone or iPad and it is running iOS 14 or higher, you must grant \"Local Network\" access to allow the smart home app to see and connect with your smart home devices.

You can even trigger a loud siren when you want to scare away unwanted visitors.\n\nYour floodlight camera includes the mounting hardware you need to get started. Simply download and install the free Roku Smart Home mobile app and use it to connect your camera to your wireless network. You will be viewing the live video stream, receiving alerts, and personalizing settings in no time.\n\nWhat you need for setup\n\nIn addition to your Roku Floodlight Camera SE and included mounting hardware, you will need a Phillips screwdriver, ladder, and the following:\n\nPower: Your floodlight camera must be hardwired to an existing junction box that provides 110 to 120V and has proper grounding. If you are not replacing an existing light, make sure to install a junction box that is either constructed of metal or contains a ground wire for proper grounding. Contact a licensed electrician to install one that follows local building codes. Before you install the floodlight yourself, check regulations in your area to make sure floodlight self-installation is legal.\nWi-Fi\u00ae: Your floodlight camera needs a 2.4GHz wireless network connection with WPA/WPA2 security standard.\nSmartphone or tablet: You will need to download and install the Roku Smart Home mobile app for iOS\u00ae or Android\u2122 to set up and control your floodlight camera.\n\nBefore you begin, familiarize yourself with your floodlight camera including the location of the status light. When it's time to access the setup button, gently lift the camera away from the motion sensor.\n\nWhere to install your floodlight camera\n\nYour floodlight must be installed in a grounded junction box and we recommend a location that is roughly 10 feet above the ground where motion can be detected up to 30 feet away. There are many great uses for your floodlight camera, including:\n\nHome security camera: Use your floodlight camera to detect and scare away intruders.\nCapture wildlife: Set up your floodlight camera to detect movement and sound from critters around your home.\n\nAfter you identify the location of your junction box, make sure the 130\u00b0 field of view for your camera is unobstructed. The motion area for triggering alerts is 270\u00b0. To get accurate notifications, try choosing a location that avoids direct sunlight, high-traffic roads, and dense brush. For help attaching your floodlight camera to the wall or ceiling, check out some mounting tips for Roku Smart Home cameras.\n\nTip: If you choose a ceiling location or another spot where your floodlight camera is upside down, you can flip the image after setup is complete. Simply select your camera in the smart home app and go to Settings  > Advanced settings > Rotate image 180\u00b0.\nGetting started\n\nFirst, make sure you have a junction box that is constructed of metal or contains a ground wire for proper grounding. If you do not have one, you will need to contact a licensed electrician to install one before you can set up your floodlight. Check your local regulations to make sure floodlight self-installation is legal.\n\nWARNING: Risk of electrical shock. Before beginning installation, disconnect power to your junction box using the fuse or circuit breaker.

Proper mounting helps to ensure you can fully utilize features of your smart home camera such as night vision and event detection. Depending on the specific model, there are different ways to mount your smart home camera. The camera setup process in the Roku Smart Home mobile app will guide you through detailed installation and mounting steps. This article will provide helpful mounting tips and best practices for placement of your camera.\n\nMounting Tips\n\nCorrect placement and mounting is important to get the most out of your smart home camera. After following the guidelines below and mounting your Roku Smart Home camera, you can customize the notifications you receive by adjusting motion and sound settings.\n\nGeneral mounting tips\n\nConsider the following tips when mounting your camera.\n\nTest the Wi-Fi\u00ae signal: Check the Wi-Fi signal with a mobile device at the location before mounting.\nCheck the viewing angle: After you set up your camera, hold it in the desired location and test for an unobstructed view by accessing the live video stream in the app.\nAvoid placement behind a window: For optimal motion detection, do not mount your camera behind a glass surface such as a window or sliding door.\nStay 3 inches away from other objects: Choosing an area where walls other objects are within three inches can increase glare, especially at night when night vision LEDs are active.\nFlip the image: If you choose a ceiling location or another spot where your camera is upside down, you can flip the image after setup is complete. Simply select your camera in the smart home app and go to Settings  > Advanced Settings > Rotate Image 180\u00b0.\nOutdoor mounting tips\n\nThere are additional considerations to take when mounting your camera outside of the home. If your outdoor camera is wireless, proper placement can improve battery life by reducing camera waking.\n\nAvoid direct sunlight: Facing the camera at direct sunlight can shorten the life of the image sensor on your camera leading to poor image quality.\nFocus away from heavy-traffic areas: Reduce unnecessary motion alerts and extend battery life by choosing a viewing angle that points away from a heavy-traffic area such as a street or busy walkway.\nAvoid passive moving plants and objects: Position your camera away from objects that move passively such as branches that blow in the wind or a clothesline.\nChoose an elevated location: Mount your camera 7 to 10 feet above the ground to better detect people and reduce alerts from vehicles and other movement in the distance.\nTilt the camera down slightly: The area where you want to record and detect motion should be in the bottom 2/3 of the image.\nMounting options\n\nMounting is optional for all Roku Smart Home cameras except the Roku Floodlight Camera SE. Refer to the chart below to see what mounting options are available for your specific camera.\n\n\u00a0\t\u00a0Screw mount\u00a0\t\u00a0Adhesive magnet mount\u00a0\t\u00a0Threaded mount\u00a0\n\u00a0Roku Indoor Camera SE\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\n\u00a0Roku Indoor Camera 360\u00b0 SE\u00a0\t\u00a0No\u00a0\t\u00a0No\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\n\u00a0Roku Outdoor Camera SE\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\t\u00a0No\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\n\u00a0Roku Outdoor Wired Camera SE\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\t\u00a0Yes\u00a0\nScrew mount\n\nCameras that support screw mounting include the proper mounting hardware, but not a Phillips screwdriver which is required. To assist when hand tightening the screwdriver, you may want to drill a pilot hole slightly smaller in diameter than the screw. If you are mounting to brick, stone, or drywall without a stud, use a drill and create a pilot hole before inserting the included plastic anchor.\n\nAdhesive magnet mount\n\nCameras that support adhesive magnet mounting include a metal plate and adhesive backing. Make sure the mounting surface and metal plate are clean and free of dirt and debris before applying the adhesive backing.\n\nThreaded mount\n\nIf your camera supports threaded mounting, it has a standard 1/4\"-20 mounting thread. Tripods and speaker stands with 1/4\"-20 threaded studs can be used as mounts.\n\nMount", "doc_id": "cbfbe5be-098c-467b-b3cb-e4be4d7bd794", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c470d15238fdf9fa00a0d3187b21454bce11c1f2665402df122990f00ca63b68", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4054}, "relationships": {"1": "c64b28d6-9c63-4144-a7c6-d1c765539d94", "3": "7d5f8de2-1261-4bd7-9fa9-a130e5758b2b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d5f8de2-1261-4bd7-9fa9-a130e5758b2b": {"__data__": {"text": "not a Phillips screwdriver which is required.

If it is just one or maybe two devices that are affected, try moving them closer to your Wi-Fi router. If all your smart home devices are affected, network instability or power fluctuations are typically to blame. Try testing the affected devices at another location like a friend's home to help rule out your network and power as the culprit.\n\nSmart home device does not turn on after a power outage\n\nSome Roku Smart Home devices have a setting called power loss recovery that allows you to configure the power state after an outage. This means you can either choose to have your device turn on automatically when recovering from a power outage, or return to the state it was in before power went out. Use the steps below to adjust this setting.\n\nOpen the smart home app\nTap Home  from the navigation bar\nChoose your device\nTap Settings \nSelect Power loss recovery\nChoose the recovery power state\nNote: If you do not see the Power loss recovery selection, the feature is not supported on your device.\n\nIf your device is configured to maintain the last power state and it was off before a recent power outage, then it will still be off when power is restored. You must turn the device on manually, and you may want to change the power loss recovery setting to turn on your device after the next power outage. If you are not able to turn on your device manually, try restarting it by unplugging the power adaptor or turning the breaker off and back on.\n\nSmart bulb is flickering\n\nPutting your Roku Smart Bulb SE into a light socket controlled by a dimmer switch is not recommended since it can cause flickering or intermittent blinking. Keep in mind that not only does this include the typical dimmer switch you may see on the wall, but also the type built into a lamp cord.\n\nIf you find that your bulb is controlled by a dimmer switch and it cannot be moved, adjust the dimmer switch to its highest level. After the flickering stops, you can dim the bulb by adjusting the brightness using the smart home app or a voice command.\n\nIf the flickering continues, test the bulb in a different socket not controlled by a dimmer switch.\n\nAdvanced troubleshooting steps\n\nIf you were not able to resolve your issue from the information in the previous sections, the general suggestions below are known to solve various issues.\n\nSet up your device again\n\nYou do not need to remove your smart home device from the mobile app to set it up again.

camera or video doorbell\n\nTwo-way audio uses the microphone and speaker built into your Roku\u00ae Smart Home camera or video doorbell to act as an intercom, letting you easily talk to visitors from the indoor safety of your home, scare away pesky critters from your yard, and give trespassers a stern warning. This article provides more details about the feature and explains how easy it is to use two-way audio.\n\nHow to use two-way audio\n\nTwo-way audio uses the speak and sound features in the Roku Smart Home mobile app for iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122 to send and receive audio. The speak feature records sound from the microphone on your mobile device and plays it through the speaker on your smart home camera or video doorbell.

The settings include motion detection, motion tracking, and motion tagging which all work together, but are adjusted independently. Smart detection is a separate feature not covered in this article, but allows your camera or doorbell to identify people, pets, packages, and vehicles when you purchase a Roku Smart Home Subscription.\n\nHow to adjust motion detection settings\n\nMotion detection sensitivity and detection zones can be used to fine-tune your camera or video doorbell. The motion detection settings work together to identify movement in a specific area. Whenever motion is detected, the status light on your camera will briefly flash red to indicate an event has been recorded.\n\nAdjust detection sensitivity\n\nDetection sensitivity determines whether big movement, low sensitivity, or small movement, high sensitivity, is needed to trigger a motion event. If you only want an alert when movement of a large object is detected, lower the sensitivity. If your camera is monitoring a small area, increase the sensitivity.\n\nYou can adjust detection sensitivity settings in the Roku Smart Home mobile app for iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122.\n\nTap Home  from the navigation bar\nSelect your camera or doorbell\nTap Settings  in the corner\nTap Detection settings\nMove the slider(s) to adjust detection sensitivity settings\n\nWhen you are done, your changes are saved automatically.\n\nAdjust motion detection zone\n\nYour camera or video doorbell might be positioned to have a wide view, but you only want to detect motion in a specific area. The detection zone feature allows you to define a specific area where your device will detect movement. Everything outside of the zone is ignored and will not trigger an event recording.\n\nYou can define the motion detection zone in the smart home app.\n\nTap Home  from the navigation bar\nSelect your camera or doorbell\nTap Settings  in the corner\nTap Detection settings\nTap Detection zone\nToggle detection zone on\nTap and drag to select the motion detection zone\nYou can tap Undo to revert recent changes or tap Clear to remove all selected grids\n\nWhen you are done, your changes are saved automatically.\n\nTip: When selecting the motion detection zone on a Roku Indoor Camera 360\u00b0 SE, you can use the directional control pad to move your camera to the view where you want to set a detection zone. The detection zone will only be active when your camera is in the selected position. If your camera moves from the position, it will automatically return after 15 seconds of inactivity.\nWhat is a passive infrared sensor\n\nSmart home cameras have a passive infrared (PIR) sensor that detects heat given off by people, warm-blooded animals, and vehicles with a warm engine. To get the full benefits of the PIR sensor, place your camera away from constant heat sources and avoid locations in direct sunlight.\n\nOn a Roku Outdoor Camera SE, you can view the effective area window in the smart home app and adjust the position of the camera to to better capture the target viewing area.\n\nTap Home  from the navigation bar\nSelect your outdoor camera\nTap Settings  in the corner\nTap Detection settings\nScroll to the PIR Effective Area at the bottom of the screen\n\nYour camera view will have a blue-green overlay showing the effective area of the sensor which is the lower two-thirds of the image. Adjust your camera's mounting position until the target viewing area is within the effective area.\n\nNote: Due to the PIR sensor's placement, it is optimized to detect side-to-side motion, as opposed to movement from the top-down. Movement from the top down and directly towards the camera are less likely to trigger the sensor.\nChange the recording cooldown\n\nThe recording cooldown setting is only available on the Roku Outdoor Camera SE. When a motion event recording is triggered, there is a cooldown period before another event can be triggered. You can select a cooldown interval of 1,", "doc_id": "11d7b9c0-c0b6-404c-b47a-7f276b42820d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a4db4628ac7a6d917fd57bc869b86848bc0e39ba72024f29c1b567a8b2e6774a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4303}, "relationships": {"1": "44329131-84e2-4e4a-9628-90949323f0cd", "3": "ed17833c-f081-482f-a56a-b0e3c9bf44fe"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed17833c-f081-482f-a56a-b0e3c9bf44fe": {"__data__": {"text": "Detection settings\nScroll to the PIR Effective Area at the bottom of the screen\n\nYour camera view will have a blue-green overlay showing the effective area of the sensor which is the lower two-thirds of the image.

When a motion event recording is triggered, there is a cooldown period before another event can be triggered. You can select a cooldown interval of 1, 3, or 5 minutes.

This feature enables your camera to detect and track motion, making it a great option for monitoring pets or children in a large room. Whenever motion is detected, your camera will move to keep the object within the camera's field of view. Once the object is out of view or after 15 seconds of inactivity, the camera will return to its initial position or continue the pan scan if one was in progress. If multiple objects are moving at the same time, your camera will follow the largest moving object. Motion tracking works together with your camera's motion detection zone. Everything outside of the motion detection zone is ignored and will not trigger motion tracking.\n\nYou can turn on motion tracking in the smart home app.\n\nTap Home  from the navigation bar\nSelect your camera\nTap More \nToggle Motion tracking\n\nThe motion tracking icon is purple  when it is on and gray  when it is off.\n\nHow to turn on motion tagging\n\nMotion tagging highlights detected movement with a green box. If multiple movements are detected, the largest will be highlighted. Motion tagging is only available on smart home cameras. When enabled, motion will be tagged outside of detection zones. However, only motion detected in the detection zone will trigger an event recording or motion tracking. Motion tagging sensitivity is not related to motion detection sensitivity and cannot be changed.\n\nWhen motion tagging is turned on, it will be visible in any recorded video including event videos, time lapses, and manually recorded videos. This setting is helpful when scanning through footage to find where there was motion. It is not possible to add, or remove, motion tagging to an already recorded video.\n\nYou can turn on motion tagging in the smart home app.\n\nTap Home  from the navigation bar\nSelect your camera\nTap More \nToggle Motion tagging\nLast updated on 11/11/2022, 3:18:52\u202fPM\nWas this article helpful?", "doc_id": "ed17833c-f081-482f-a56a-b0e3c9bf44fe", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4bf21d50ca5e21d9f1387693ecf8bb48af7da037637caf385aebb4258664366b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3500, "end": 6715}, "relationships": {"1": "44329131-84e2-4e4a-9628-90949323f0cd", "2": "11d7b9c0-c0b6-404c-b47a-7f276b42820d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "87722173-faea-4868-ac11-631f7cc210e7": {"__data__": {"text": "How to set up and view recordings on your Roku Smart Home camera or video doorbell\n\nYour Roku\u00ae Smart Home camera can capture several different types of recordings including event, continuous, scheduled, and time lapse recordings. Some recording features are only available on specific smart home cameras. Video doorbells can only capture event recordings as they do not have a micro SD card slot. Recordings can be saved to the cloud when you purchase a Roku Smart Home Subscription or backed up to a micro SD card. In addition to the previous recording features mentioned, you can also manually capture a video or photo of the live video stream on both smart home cameras and video doorbells. Your recordings can be viewed in the Roku Smart Home mobile app or from the micro SD card they were recorded on. You can learn how to install and manage micro SD card recordings.\n\nHow to set up event recordings\n\nEach time your smart home camera or video doorbell detects motion or sound, it captures a video clip and saves it as an event recording. When you purchase a Roku Smart Home Subscription, an event recording is stored in the cloud for 14 days, but you can also choose to back it up simultaneously to a micro SD card in case the internet connection is lost. Without a subscription, an event recording is stored as a single image, but you can also choose to back up a video recording to a micro SD card. An event recording stored in the cloud can be accessed from the Roku Smart Home mobile app. To view an event recording backed up on a micro SD card, you must remove the card and connect it to your computer.\n\nChange detection settings\n\nYou can set your smart home camera or video doorbell to record an event when it detects motion and/or sound. If neither detection setting is enabled, the camera will not record events. You can change detection settings for motion and sound in the app.\n\nSelect your camera from the Homescreen\nTap Settings  in the corner\nTap Event Recording\nToggle each detection setting on or off\n\nYou can change the zone detection, motion tagging, and sensitivity settings further to adjust when an event recording is triggered. If you purchase a smart home subscription, smart detection can be used to identify when an event is triggered by a person, pet, vehicle, or package.\n\nToggle alarm detection\n\nSmart sound recognition uses an advanced algorithm that recognizes the sound patterns of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide (CO) monitors. When an alarm sound is detected, a 12 second event video is generated, and a push notification is sent by the smart home app.\n\nYou can change smart sound recognition settings in the app.\n\nSelect your camera from the Homescreen\nTap Settings  in the corner\nTap Alarm Settings\nToggle the alarm settings on or off\nNote: If you have Detect Sound off, you can still use smart sound recognition to send a notification when the camera detects an alarm sound.\nManage automation rules\n\nAutomation rules can be used to trigger an event recording. You can create a rule to \"Upload a short video to the cloud\" at a specific time from a specific camera. Learn how to use rules to automate your smart home devices.\n\nHow to view event recordings\n\nYou can find your event recordings on the Roku Smart Home app in the Events tab. You must purchase a smart home subscription to view event video recordings saved to the cloud. If you do not have a subscription, you can only view a still image of the event. On the Events screen, tap an event to watch the video or view the image. If you want to view recordings saved to a micro SD card, you need to remove the micro SD card from the camera and watch it on your computer.\n\nFilter event recordings\n\nYou can filter events by camera group, camera, smart detection, and trigger source. Filtering by smart detection (person, package, vehicle, pet) is only available with a smart home subscription. Automation events cannot be filtered.

With IR lights, your Roku Smart Home cameras are also able to capture an image in extremely low light conditions. Your video doorbell has a white light LED to help capture better quality video in a dark environment.\n\nThis article provides more details and teaches you how to use night vision and its related features.\n\nHow night vision works\n\nNight vision lets your smart home cameras and video doorbell capture a black and white image when there is low levels of light so you can still keep an eye on your home, day or night. When the feature is on during the daytime, color night vision is engaged capturing available ambient light to create a \"false color\" and display the live stream in color. There are three night vision modes.\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\n\nAuto: Color night vision turns on during the day and night vision turns on during low-light conditions automatically based on your preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\n\nOn: Night vision remains on regardless of the light conditions and always displays a black and white image.\n\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\n\nOff: Night vision remains off no matter how dark the light conditions are.\n\nWhen night vision is set to Auto or On and you need a better view in a dark environment, you can turn on the IR lights on your camera or the LED light on your video doorbell.\n\nIR lights\n\nThe IR lights on your smart home cameras detect radiated heat, allowing you to see things invisible to the human eye. The IR lights can be turned on only when night vision is engaged to better capture events in the darkest conditions. You can turn the IR lights on and off for all cameras, while the Roku Indoor Camera SE, Roku Outdoor Wired Camera SE, and the Roku Floodlight Camera SE add the ability to choose between two modes when the IR lights are on.\n\nFar: 850nm wavelengths meant for outdoor use and capturing objects far away from your camera. Four red lights may be visible on the front of the camera.\nNear: 940nm wavelengths intended for indoor use and capturing events closer to your camera. No lights are visible on the front of the camera.\nWhite light LED\n\nThere is a white light LED on the front of your smart home video doorbell that turns on when someone rings the doorbell, or a video is recording in low light. Enable both night vision and white light LED to get better video quality at night and see who is at your door when it is dark.\n\nHow to turn on night vision\n\nTo turn on night vision, select your camera or doorbell in the Roku Smart Home mobile app and access the live video stream or the Settings menu using the appropriate instructions below.\n\nLive video stream\nOpen the Home  screen\nSelect your camera or doorbell to access the live video stream\nToggle the night vision icon to Auto  or On \n\nTo turn night vision off, repeat the steps and toggle the night vision icon to Off \n\nSettings menu\nOpen the Home  screen\nSelect your camera or doorbell\nTap Settings \nTap Advanced settings\nSelect Auto or On under Night vision.\nAdjust night vision conditions\n\nWhen night vision is on, you can save a lighting conditions preference to determine how night vision works on your compatible camera based on its location.

However, your Roku Outdoor Camera SE offers enhancements like presets that are detailed below.\n\nWhat are presets?\n\nWhen you set up a custom time lapse recording, you must choose a start time, the duration, and an interval, or how often to capture an image. To take the guessing out of determining the best interval for every situation, your outdoor camera includes the presets described below, each with a fixed interval that cannot be changed.\n\nClouds: With a very short interval, this preset is intended for capturing quick-moving events like clouds rolling over a seaside hill.\nSunrise and Sunset: A short interval best suited for slower-moving events like a sunrise or sunset. The start time and duration defaults to the sunrise and sunset in your local area and can be adjusted if you prefer.\nFlower Blossom: A long interval to capture very slow-moving events like a plant growing or a flower blooming.\nHow to set up a time lapse recording\n\nBefore you begin, install a micro SD in your outdoor camera and then open the Roku Smart Home mobile app. As you adjust the start time, duration, and interval, you will see the final video length and estimated file size. If a video is longer than 30 seconds, it may take a while to download.\n\nNotes:\nYou can capture a time lapse simultaneously with a scheduled recording, but using these features together will drain your camera battery more quickly.\nA micro SD card installed in the base station can be used to back up your recordings but cannot capture recordings directly from your camera.\n\nUse the following instructions to set up a time lapse recording.\n\nTap Home  from the navigation bar\nSelect your outdoor camera\nTap More \nTap Time lapse\nIf desired, choose a preset\nChoose the start time, duration, and/or interval\nTap Set to schedule your time lapse\n\nThe Timelapse screen will display a reminder with the start time.

When the scan is successful you will hear \"QR code scanned... please wait\". If you do not hear this phrase, try cleaning the camera lens or screen, and check that your phone or tablet is connected to the correct network. Details surrounding these suggestions are provided below.\n\nNote: The QR code discussed in this article is different from the QR code you may see on product packaging or a quick start guide.\nWhat is a QR code?\n\nA quick response (QR) code stores information as a set of pixels in a square grid that can be read by a digital device, like the camera in your phone or tablet. Roku uses this technology to share Wi-Fi\u00ae information like the network name (or SSID) making it quicker and easier to connect your smart camera or doorbell.\n\nCheck your devices\n\nA QR code stays active for 5 minutes. If more than 5 minutes elapse before you are able to successfully scan the code, go back and let the smart home app generate a new QR code.\n\nWhen scanning the code, hold your camera or doorbell about 5 inches from the screen on your phone or tablet for at least 5 seconds.\n\nIf you do not hear \"QR code scanned... please wait\", check your different devices.\n\nCamera or doorbell\nIf still attached from the factory, remove the protective film from the camera lens.\nCheck for smudges or dust and gently wipe the camera lens using a soft, microfiber cloth.\nPhone or tablet\nInspect the screen for greasy fingerprints or dirt and wipe it clean.\nIf a screen protector is installed and damaged, temporarily remove it and try the scan again.\nCheck the screen for cracked glass and try adjusting the angle of the scan. If the damage is severe enough, you may need to scan the code with a different mobile device.\nMake sure the entire QR code is visible and not obstructed by something obvious like your fingertip or fingernail.\nIf you use an Apple device, turn off \"smart invert\" or \"classic invert.\" This setting changes the way colors are displayed and may cause the scan to fail.\nAdjust the scan\n\nOnce your devices are clean and in good order, try adjusting how you are scanning the QR code with the following suggestions.\n\nIf the screen on your mobile device is larger than 5.5 inches, you may need to hold your camera or doorbell more than 5 inches from the QR code.\nPull your camera or doorbell about 12 inches from the QR code and slowly move it closer and hold it for 5 seconds at various distances until the scan is successful.\nHold the QR code upside down and then refocus your camera or doorbell by slowly adjusting the distance.\nTo account for glare, slightly adjust the angle of your camera or doorbell. If that does not help, try scanning the QR code somewhere with different lighting especially if you are outdoors or near direct sunlight.\n\nIf none of the suggestions resolved the issue, try to factory reset your camera or doorbell and attempt the setup process again.\n\nCheck the Wi-Fi connection\n\nMost Roku Smart Home devices cannot connect to a 5GHz Wi-Fi network. If you have a dual-band router*, make sure to connect your phone or tablet to your 2.4GHz wireless network from the settings for this device before launching the smart home app. For help, learn how to identify and connect to your 2.4GHz network.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*A note on terminology:\n\nTo access your network and ultimately the internet, you will typically connect to a device called a router but it may also be referred to as a wireless router, wireless access point, home gateway or cable modem.

For this to work, your Roku device must maintain a good connection to your network and the internet. At any time, you can check the quality of this connection from the Settings menu on your Roku device.\n\nHow to begin a connection check\n\nYou can initiate a connection check with the following steps:\n\nPress Home  on your Roku remote\nScroll and select Settings.\nSelect Network\nSelect Check connection\n\nNote: If your Roku device is not connected to your network, you need to select Set up connection to connect to your network and the internet before you can continue.\nWhat does the connection check do?\n\nIf you are using a wireless network, your Roku device begins by checking the signal strength of available wireless networks to determine if a better option is available from your router (this is skipped if you are using a wired network). If a stronger wireless signal is detected, you will see an on-screen message suggesting you connect to a recommended network. If the recommended network requires a different password, you will be prompted to enter one.\n\nNext, your Roku device tries to connect to the wireless or wired network in your home. If successful, your Roku device then attempts to connect to the internet. A green check appears for each successful connection, while a red \u2018x\u2019 appears if a connection cannot be established.\n\nWhen a green check appears for both connections, your Roku device has successfully connected to your network and the internet. In these cases, your Roku device will also test the strength of each connection and present the results. When the tests for both connections are complete, the connection check ends and you are presented the message, Connection check was successful.\n\nIf either connection tests poorly, an on-screen message presents an error code and a brief list of suggestions to help improve the connection. For help with an error code, learn more about how to resolve connectivity issues.\n\nReview the connection check results\n\nYou can access and review the results of the most recent connection check by visiting Settings > Network > About.\n\nIf your Roku device is connected via wireless network, there are two items to check.\n\nSignal strength: A measure of the strength of the wireless signal from your router*.\nInternet download speed: A measure of the speed of your internet connection. The date of the connection check is also reported.\n\nIf your Roku device has an Ethernet port or it supports a Fast Ethernet adapter and you are using a wired connection, Signal strength will not appear. You will only see results for Internet download speed.\n\nYou can use the product comparison chart to determine which current products have Ethernet.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nIf you performed a successful connection check recently, you will see results for Signal strength (for a wireless connection) and Internet download speed. The values of both should be evaluated together to fully understand the quality of your network connection. Each is explained in more detail below.\n\nSignal strength\n\nYou will see one of the values described below:\n\nExcellent: The wireless signal from the router to your Roku device is ideal for streaming.\nGood: The wireless signal is strong and suitable for streaming.\nFair: The wireless signal is not as strong, but is likely still suitable for streaming.\nPoor: The wireless signal is weak which may cause playback issues and/or unpredictable behavior, and may negatively effect internet download speed.
