CALVINIST PARROT

The Calvinist Parrot project embarked on an ambitious journey to create an AI-powered chatbot to facilitate a deeper understanding and exploration of the Bible from a Reformed theology perspective. The initial version utilized a duo of AI agents, Parrot and Calvin, to provide insightful and accurate responses to user queries on religious texts. The chatbot was envisioned as a tool and a learning companion that continually evolves to enhance user interactions and deepen their understanding of religious texts.

GOAL

Engineer an AI-driven chatbot capable of providing thoughtful, accurate, and insightful responses to queries about the Bible from a Reformed theology standpoint.
Continually enhance the AI's comprehension and response capabilities to foster a more profound exploration of Scriptures for users.

SOLUTIONS

Initially, the solution entailed the development of an AI chatbot employing two GPT agents working in tandem, with responses curated and calibrated to align with the principles of Reformed theology. A feedback loop was incorporated to allow for continuous learning and improvement based on user feedback.
Version 2.0 Enhancements:

To significantly reduce hallucinations and provide a more enriched user experience, the Calvinist Parrot evolved into an autonomous agent utilizing 11 distinct query engines to search through the vast Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL). GPT-3.5 powers the query engines, while the primary agent leverages the capabilities of GPT-4.

Library Indexing and Categorization: One of the major challenges was indexing the extensive library, which led to the creation of a novel algorithm (patent in process) for analyzing books, generating multiple categories, and forming numerous query engines. This was a monumental step towards making the vast amount of religious texts accessible and searchable.

Autonomous Query Execution: The autonomous agent now decides on the most appropriate query engine to respond to user queries, significantly enhancing the chatbot's ability to provide accurate and insightful responses.

FINDINGS

The advancements in version 2.0 yielded notable results:

Reduction in Hallucinations: The utilization of multiple query engines significantly reduced hallucinations, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the chatbot's responses.
Improved Response Depth: By accessing the extensive Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL) through tailored query engines, the chatbot could provide more insightful and well-informed responses to users' inquiries regarding Reformed theology and biblical texts.
Enhanced User Experience: The autonomous nature of the updated chatbot, aided by the innovative indexing algorithm, delivered a more enriched user experience by providing quicker and more precise answers to a broader range of queries.

TAKEAWAYS

The evolution of the Calvinist Parrot project emphasized several technical and innovative breakthroughs:

Algorithm Development: Creating a novel algorithm for indexing and categorizing a massive library was a crucial breakthrough. This algorithm was instrumental in organizing the extensive Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL) into manageable and searchable categories.
Autonomous Query Execution: Engineering an autonomous agent capable of selecting the appropriate query engine demonstrated a significant technical advancement, paving the way for more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Multi-Container and Multi-Build Architecture for Performance Optimization: The Calvinist Parrot project employed a robust multi-container and multi-build approach, where each Docker container housed a distinct query engine. This architectural strategy was pivotal in managing the extensive library effectively without resorting to larger-than-necessary instances. Optimized performance was achieved by segregating different sections of the library into individual containers and employing a multi-build approach for processing. This led to faster response times, lower resource utilization, and a streamlined user experience.
