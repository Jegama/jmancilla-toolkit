ABOUT ME
Throughout my career as a Quantitative UX Researcher, I have been dedicated to data-driven design and improving the user experience. While at Roku Inc., I led the development of an AI-powered database and advanced survey analysis systems, providing valuable insights across millions of interactions. My expertise was further demonstrated at Walmart Global Tech, where I combined analytics with user research to inform human-centered design. In previous positions at Scrapworks Inc. and Suggestic, I honed my skills in recommendation algorithms and interface usability, translating complex data into compelling user experiences. With a strong foundation in rigorous research and a passion for continuous innovation, I am committed to uncovering the subtleties of user behavior to ensure that every product resonates with its target audience.

I am dedicated to continuous learning, and pushing the boundaries of innovation drives me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements, all while championing user-centric design and research. Notable endeavors, such as the AI-driven Research Librarian and the autonomous Support Bot, underscore my capability to harness the power of AI in enhancing user interactions and insights.
