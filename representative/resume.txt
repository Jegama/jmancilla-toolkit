ABOUT ME
Throughout my career, I have adapted to new challenges and utilized AI to solve complex problems. Starting as a Quantitative UX Researcher, I've grown into a Machine Learning Engineer and successfully merged domain knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques in projects like the Calvinist Parrot. My passion for AI and research has led me to seek opportunities that will allow me to contribute to cutting-edge research and expand my expertise. Joining an AI research lab would align perfectly with my goals and allow me to continue pushing the frontiers of AI.
