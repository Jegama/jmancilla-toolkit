ML PORTFOLIO
I have evolved from a Quant UX researcher to a Machine Learning Engineer throughout my career through continuous learning and adaptation. My user experience and quantitative research background has given me a unique perspective on machine learning. I aim to create technically sound ML models with practical applications while keeping the users at the center of my approach. My diverse range of projects attests to my expertise and skills in machine learning.

MODULAR SURVEY ANALYSIS SYSTEM
The Modular Survey Analysis System is a significant upgrade to the automatic report generator I initially developed for handling weekly, monthly, and quarterly surveys. This project, which will span four months starting in June 2023, aims to create a flexible and efficient system for analyzing survey data. The system was designed to increase output with fewer resources and provide a scalable solution for analyzing various surveys with diverse question sets. The main goal was to enable the team to analyze surveys in minutes, significantly improving efficiency and productivity.

The project was divided into three phases. The first phase focused on developing a modular report generator, automating the classification of familiar question types. The second phase incorporated context-aware survey logic and plot generation, enabling the system to analyze surveys with more complex structures. The final phase fine-tuned the plots generated by the system and expanded its capabilities to include other types of survey questions. By the end of the project, the Modular Survey Analysis System had become a robust and versatile tool capable of handling a broad range of survey structures and complexities, providing more comprehensive analysis capabilities.

CALVINIST PARROT
The Calvinist Parrot project exemplified the incredible potential of AI in enhancing user engagement with religious texts. Through rigorous development, I created an AI-powered chatbot duo named Parrot and Calvin, which was explicitly trained on various texts, including religious commentary and historical context. Its ultimate goal was to provide users with thoughtful, accurate, and insightful responses to their inquiries about the Scriptures from a Reformed theology perspective.

To ensure that Parrot and Calvin provided the best possible guidance, I created a feedback loop that allowed continuous learning and improvement. By utilizing user feedback, we were able to refine the chatbot's understanding and response generation, ensuring that its guidance remained accurate, insightful, and aligned with the principles of Reformed theology.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT BOT
I aimed to improve customer support with the help of cutting-edge AI technology. I developed an autonomous agent that could provide prompt and concise responses to user queries, thereby reducing the workload on our call center and improving self-service for our users. 

I used advanced AI technologies like embeddings and GPT-3.5 to power the agent. I also created a comprehensive index of all the articles on a CS site, in this case, Roku, to ensure users could easily access the most relevant information. The development process involved indexing all the support site articles and creating a library catalog. Next, I used embeddings to search for the most relevant content and then utilized the advanced AI model of GPT-3.5 to generate a response. This has greatly improved the efficiency of our customer support system, allowing us to provide faster and more accurate solutions to our users.
