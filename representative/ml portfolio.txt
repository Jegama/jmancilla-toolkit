ML PORTFOLIO
I have evolved from a Quant UX researcher to a Machine Learning Engineer throughout my career through continuous learning and adaptation. My user experience and quantitative research background has given me a unique perspective on machine learning. I aim to create technically sound ML models with practical applications while keeping the users at the center of my approach. My diverse range of projects attests to my expertise and skills in machine learning.

CALVINIST PARROT
The Calvinist Parrot project showcases the evolution of an AI-driven chatbot designed to deepen user engagement with Reformed theology and biblical texts. Initially launched with a duo of GPT agents, Parrot and Calvin, the chatbot has now advanced and a multi-build approach with 11 distinct query engines to peruse the expansive Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL). This transformation was made possible through significant technical and innovative strides, including developing a novel algorithm for efficient library indexing and categorization.

The upgraded version 2.0 embodies a blend of sophisticated AI applications and a robust multi-container and multi-build architecture, ensuring optimized performance and a rich user experience. Each Docker container housing a distinct query engine and a multi-build approach underscored the project's focus on performance optimization and resource efficiency. This technical initiative has significantly reduced response hallucinations and enriched the chatbotâ€™s response depth, showcasing a harmonious blend of theological inquiry and cutting-edge technology.

MODULAR SURVEY ANALYSIS SYSTEM

I developed the Modular Survey Analysis System, an evolution of the initial survey report generator. This new system streamlined the process by moving away from a static, hard-coded approach to a more dynamic, modular method, ensuring efficient categorization of diverse questions. A significant part of this project was integrating context-aware logic and enhancing the data interpretation process. One of the key components I'm particularly proud of is the autonomous clustering algorithm designed for open-ended responses. Currently, in the patenting process, this algorithm demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing a common challenge in survey analysis.

The development process presented several challenges. One such challenge was the inconsistency in the survey data due to its diverse nature. I addressed this by incorporating precise preprocessing techniques, ensuring data uniformity. Additionally, I encountered surveys with complex logic and dependencies. To tackle this, I designed a logic parser that effectively managed these intricacies. The open-ended responses, inherently subjective, were another challenge. My solution, the clustering algorithm, effectively categorizes and describes these responses, underscoring my dedication to creating efficient and reliable solutions.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT BOT
I aimed to improve customer support with the help of cutting-edge AI technology. I developed an autonomous agent that could provide prompt and concise responses to user queries, thereby reducing the workload on our call center and improving self-service for our users. 

I used advanced AI technologies like embeddings and GPT-3.5 to power the agent. I also created a comprehensive index of all the articles on a CS site, in this case, Roku, to ensure users could easily access the most relevant information. The development process involved indexing all the support site articles and creating a library catalog. Next, I used embeddings to search for the most relevant content and then utilized the advanced AI model of GPT-3.5 to generate a response. This has greatly improved the efficiency of our customer support system, allowing us to provide faster and more accurate solutions to our users.
