SURVEY REPORT GENERATOR

I developed an automatic report generator that takes a weekly survey and generates the report without human intervention. This entry explains the upgraded version.

Implementing the Modular Survey Analysis System will significantly improve our team's report generator. With this new system, survey data analysis will be more flexible and efficient, allowing for faster results with fewer resources needed. This scalable solution will also be able to handle a variety of surveys with different question sets. Overall, the Modular Survey Analysis System will significantly enhance our ability to analyze survey data and provide valuable insights.

GOAL
The main goal of this project is to enable the team to analyze surveys sent in minutes and increase the team's output with fewer available resources. 
The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, capable of handling multiple surveys with diverse question sets without requiring manual adjustments or hard-coding new questions.

PHASE 1: 
DEVELOPING THE MODULAR REPORT GENERATOR
During the initial stage of the project, I will focus on creating a modular report generator. Although the current automated report generator I developed for the weekly surveys is efficient, it faces limitations because of its hard-coded questions. This makes it less adaptable to handle various surveys with diverse questions. I intend to automate the classification of familiar questions to overcome this issue. This approach will enable us to test the algorithm's ability to classify various questions, providing a proof of concept for the system. By the end of this stage, the system will be able to categorize familiar questions into demographic, Likert scale, categorical (single select and multiple select), and open-ended categories. This foundational work will pave the way for more advanced features in subsequent stages.

PHASE 2: 
IMPLEMENTING CONTEXT-AWARE SURVEY LOGIC AND PLOT GENERATION
The second phase will build on the foundation established in Phase 1. This phase will enhance the Modular Survey Analysis System by incorporating context-aware survey logic and plot generation. This will enable the system to analyze surveys with more complex structures and dependencies between questions, providing a deeper understanding of the data. 

Furthermore, the system will be developed to parse survey logic, identifying dependencies and relationships between questions. This will allow for context-aware plot generation that accurately represents the data, considering the relationships between questions and providing meaningful insights. Upon completion of Phase 2, the system will be capable of handling complex survey logic and generating context-aware plots.

PHASE 3: 
ENHANCING PLOT CUSTOMIZATION AND EXPANDING SURVEY QUESTION CAPABILITIES
The upcoming phase of this project will enhance the system's capabilities in generating plots and including other types of survey questions. Through this phase, the system will be more adaptable and customizable to meet specific analysis requirements, providing our organization with more value. The plots generated by the system will be optimized to ensure they accurately represent the data and provide insightful observations. Furthermore, expanding the system's capabilities to include ranking, matrix, and slider scale questions will enable the Modular Survey Analysis System to handle a broader range of survey structures and complexities, providing more comprehensive analysis capabilities.

CONCLUSION
The team aims to completely transform how we approach survey analysis by implementing the Modular Survey Analysis System. By leveraging familiar questions and enhancing our existing reporting capabilities, we have created a reliable and flexible solution that has significantly increased our productivity while utilizing fewer resources. The versatility of this system allows it to be easily adapted for various surveys, making it a wise investment for our organization.
